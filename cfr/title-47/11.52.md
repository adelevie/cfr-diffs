(a) EAS Participants must be capable of receiving the Attention Signal required by § 11.32(a)(9) and emergency messages of other broadcast stations during their hours of operation. EAS Participants must install and operate during their hours of operation, equipment capable of receiving and decoding, either automatically or manually, the EAS header codes, emergency messages and EOM code. EAS Participants must comply with these requirements by the dates set forth in § 11.11.
                                    

(b) If manual interrupt is used as authorized in § 11.51(m)(2), decoders must be located so that operators at their normal duty stations can be alerted immediately when EAS messages are received.

(c) EAS Participants that are co-owned and co-located with a combined studio or control facility (such as an AM and FM licensed to the same entity and at the same location or a cable headend serving more than one system) may comply with the EAS monitoring requirements contained in this section for the combined station or system with one EAS Decoder. The requirements of § 11.33 must be met by the combined facility.

(d) EAS Participants must monitor two EAS sources. The monitoring assignments of each broadcast station and cable system and wireless cable system are specified in the State EAS Plan and FCC Mapbook. They are developed in accordance with FCC monitoring priorities.

(1) If the required EAS sources cannot be received, alternate arrangements or a waiver may be obtained by written request to the FCC's EAS office. In an emergency, a waiver may be issued over the telephone with a follow up letter to confirm temporary or permanent reassignment.

(2) The management of EAS Participants shall determine which header codes will automatically interrupt their programming for State and Local Area emergency situations affecting their audiences.

(e) EAS Participants are required to interrupt normal programming either automatically or manually when they receive an EAS message in which the header code contains the Event codes for Emergency Action Notification (EAN), Emergency Action Termination (EAT), and Required Monthly Test (RMT) for their State or State/county location.

(1) Automatic interrupt of programming is required when facilities are unattended. Automatic operation must provide a permanent record of the EAS message that contains at a minimum the following information: Originator, Event, Location and valid time period of the message.

(2) Manual interrupt of programming and transmission of EAS messages may be used. EAS messages with the EAN Event code must be transmitted immediately and Monthly EAS test messages within 60 minutes. All actions must be logged and recorded as specified in §§ 11.35(a) and 11.54(b)(13). Decoders must be programmed for the EAN and EAT Event header codes for National level emergencies and the RMT and RWT Event header codes for required monthly and weekly tests, with the appropriate accompanying State and State/county location codes.
