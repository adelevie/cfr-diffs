The license for a low power auxiliary station authorizes the transmission of cues and orders to production personnel and participants in broadcast programs and motion pictures and in the preparation therefor, the transmission of program material by means of a wireless microphone worn by a performer and other participants in a program or motion picture during rehearsal and during the actual broadcast, filming, or recording, or the transmission of comments, interviews, and reports from the scene of a remote broadcast. Low power auxiliary stations operating in the 944-952 MHz band may, in addition, transmit synchronizing signals and various control signals to portable or hand-carried TV cameras which employ low power radio signals in lieu of cable to deliver picture signals to the control point at the scene of a remote broadcast.
