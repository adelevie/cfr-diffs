(a) The radio direction finding apparatus must:

(1) Be capable of receiving signals A1A, A2B and R2B emission, on each frequency within the band 285-515 kHz assigned by the Radio Regulations for distress and direction finding and for maritime radio beacons, and be calibrated to take bearings on such signals from which the true bearing and direction may be determined; and

(2) Possess a sensitivity, sufficient to permit the taking of bearings on a signal having a field strength of 50 microvolts per meter.

(b) The calibration of the direction finder must be verified by check bearings or by a further calibration whenever any changes are made in the physical or electrical characteristics or the position of any antennas, and whenever any changes are made in the position of any deck structures which might affect the accuracy of the direction finder. In addition, the calibration must be verified by check bearings at yearly intervals. A record of the calibrations, and of the check bearings made of their accuracy and the accuracy of the check bearings must be kept on board the ship for a period of not less than 1 year.
