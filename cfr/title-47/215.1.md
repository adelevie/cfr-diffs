(a) The nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is part of the complex environment produced by nuclear explosions. It consists of transient voltages and currents which can cause malfunctioning and serious damage to electrical and electronic equipment.

(b) The Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) is the overall technical coordinator for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and DOE laboratories on matters concerning nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons effects, and nuclear weapons testing. It acts as the focal point between the service laboratories and other agencies. The National Communications System (NCS), with the Defense Communications Agency (DCA), maintains a data base for telecommunications. DCA also provides the primary capability for the NCS to conduct telecommunications survivability studies for civil and military departments and agencies.

(c) In order to disseminate among affected Federal agencies information concerning the telecommunications effects of EMP and available protective measures, and in order to avoid duplication of research efforts, it is desirable to designate a focal point within the Federal Government for telecommunications EMP matters.
