The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called the EAJA in this subpart), provides for the award of attorney's fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called adversary adjudications) before the Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Commission, unless the Commission's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust, or when the demand of the Commission is substantially in excess of the decision in the adversary adjudication and is unreasonable when compared with such decision, under the facts and circumstances of the case, unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.
