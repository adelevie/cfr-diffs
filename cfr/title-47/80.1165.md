Frequencies for general radiotelephone purposes are available to ships in three radio frequency bands. Use of specific frequencies must meet the Commission's rules concerning the scope of service and the class of station with which communications are intended. The three frequency bands are:

(a) 156-158 MHz (VHF/FM Radiotelephone). Certain frequencies within this band are public correspondence frequencies and they must be used as working channels when communicating with public coast stations. Other working frequencies within the band are categorized by type of communications for which use is authorized when communicating with a private coast station or between ships. Subpart H of this part lists the frequencies and types of communications for which they are available.

(b) 1600-4000 kHz (SSB Radiotelephone). Specific frequencies within this band are authorized for single sideband (SSB) communications with public and private coast stations or between ships. The specific frequencies are listed in subpart H of this part.
                

(c) 4000-23000 kHz (SSB Radiotelephone). Specific frequencies within this band are authorized for SSB communications with public and private coast stations. The specific frequencies are listed in subpart H of this part.
