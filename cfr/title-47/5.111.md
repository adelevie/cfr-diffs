(a) The following transmission limitations are applicable to all classes of stations in the Experimental Radio Service:
              

(1) Stations may make only such transmissions as are necessary and directly related to the conduct of the licensee's stated program of experimentation as specified in the application for license and the related station instrument of authorization, and as governed by the provisions of the rules and regulations contained in this part. All transmissions shall be limited to the minimum practical transmission time.

(2) When transmitting, the licensee must use every precaution to ensure that the radio frequency energy emitted will not cause harmful interference to the services carried on by stations operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations of part 2 of this chapter and, further, that the power radiated is reduced to the lowest practical value consistent with the program of experimentation for which the station authorization is granted. If harmful interference to an established radio service develops, the licensee shall cease transmissions and such transmissions shall not be resumed until it is certain that harmful interference will not be caused.

(b) If experimental stations are to be used to retransmit signals of any other station or to render any communications service to third parties, a full disclosure of this must be made in the application for license.
