(a) It is the policy of the Commission that extensions of time shall not be routinely granted.

(b) Motions for extension of time in which to file responses to petitions for rulemaking, replies to such responses, comments filed in response to notice of proposed rulemaking, replies to such comments and other filings in rulemaking proceedings conducted under Subpart C of this part shall be filed at least 7 days before the filing date. If a timely motion is denied, the responses and comments, replies thereto, or other filings need not be filed until 2 business days after the Commission acts on the motion. In emergency situations, the Commission will consider a late-filed motion for a brief extension of time related to the duration of the emergency and will consider motions for acceptance of comments, reply comments or other filings made after the filing date.

(c) If a motion for extension of time in which to make filings in proceedings other than notice and comment rule making proceedings is filed less than 7 days prior to the filing day, the party filing the motion shall (in addition to serving the motion on other parties) orally notify other parties and Commission staff personnel responsible for acting on the motion that the motion has been (or is being) filed.
