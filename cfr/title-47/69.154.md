(a) Local exchange carriers may recover a per-minute carrier common line charge from interexchange carriers, collected on originating access minutes and calculated using the weighting method set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. The maximum such charge shall be the lower of:

(1) The per-minute rate using base period demand that would recover the maximum allowable carrier common line revenue as defined in ยง 61.46(d) of this chapter; or

(2) The sum of the local switching, carrier common line and interconnection charge charges assessed on originating minutes on December 31, 1997, minus the local switching charges assessed on originating minutes.

(b) To the extent that paragraph (a) of this section does not recover from interexchange carriers all permitted carrier common line revenue, the excess may be collected through a per-minute charge on terminating access calculated using the weighting method set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
              

(c) For each Carrier Common Line access element tariff, the premium originating Carrier Common Line charge shall be set at a level that recovers revenues allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The non-premium charges shall be equal to .45 multiplied by the premium charges.
