(a) The radiotelephone station is a radiotelephone installation and other equipment necessary for the proper operation of the installation.

(b) The radiotelephone station must be installed to insure safe and effective operation of the equipment and to facilitate repair. Adequate protection must be provided against the effects of vibration, moisture, and temperature.

(c) The radiotelephone station and all necessary controls must be located at the level of the main wheelhouse or at least one deck above the ship's main deck.

(d) The principal operating position of the radiotelephone station must be in the room from which the ship is normally steered while at sea. In installations on cargo ships of 300 gross tons and upwards but less than 500 gross tons on which the keel was laid prior to January 1, 1965, the location of the principal operating controls may be in a room adjoining and opening into the room from which the vessel is normally steered while at sea. If the station can be operated from any location other than the principal operating position, a positive means must be provided at the principal operating position to take full control of the station.
