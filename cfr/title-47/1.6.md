(a) Station records and logs shall be made available for inspection or duplication at the request of the Commission or its representative. Such logs or records may be removed from the licensee's possession by a Commission representative or, upon request, shall be mailed by the licensee to the Commission by either registered mail, return receipt requested, or certified mail, return receipt requested. The return receipt shall be retained by the licensee as part of the station records until such records or logs are returned to the licensee. A receipt shall be furnished when the logs or records are removed from the licensee's possession by a Commission representative and this receipt shall be retained by the licensee as part of the station records until such records or logs are returned to the licensee. When the Commission has no further need for such records or logs, they shall be returned to the licensee. The provisions of this rule shall apply solely to those station logs and records which are required to be maintained by the provisions of this chapter.

(b) Where records or logs are maintained as the official records of a recognized law enforcement agency and the removal of the records from the possession of the law enforcement agency will hinder its law enforcement activities, such records will not be removed pursuant to this section if the chief of the law enforcement agency promptly certifies in writing to the Federal Communications Commission that removal of the logs or records will hinder law enforcement activities of the agency, stating insofar as feasible the basis for his decision and the date when it can reasonably be expected that such records will be released to the Federal Communications Commission.
