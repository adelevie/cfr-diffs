(a) Each TV broadcast station shall be equipped with indicating instruments which conform with the specifications described in ยง 73.1215 for measuring the operating parameters of the last radio stage of the visual transmitter, and with such other instruments as are necessary for the proper adjustment, operation, and maintenance of the visual transmitting system.

(b) The function of each instrument shall be clearly and permanently shown on the instrument itself or on the panel immediately adjacent thereto.

(c) In the event that any one of these indicating instruments becomes defective, when no substitute which conforms with the required specifications is available, the station may be operated without the defective instrument pending its repair or replacement for a period not in excess of 60 days without further authority of the FCC, provided that:

(1) If the defective instrument is the transmission line meter used for determining the output power by the direct method, the operating power shall be determined or maintained by the indirect method whenever possible or by using the operating parameters of the last radio stage of the transmitter during the time the station is operated without the transmission line meter.

(2) If conditions beyond the control of the licensee prevent the restoration of the meter to service within the above allowed period, informal request in accordance with ยง 73.3549 may be filed with the Engineer in Charge of the radio district in which the station is located for such additional time as may be required to complete repairs of the defective instrument.
