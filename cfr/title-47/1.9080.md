(a) Overview. A “private commons” arrangement is an arrangement, distinct from a spectrum leasing arrangement but permitted in the same services for which spectrum leasing arrangements are allowed, in which a licensee or spectrum lessee makes certain spectrum usage rights under a particular license authorization available to a class of third-party users employing advanced communications technologies that involve peer-to-peer (device-to-device) communications and that do not involve use of the licensee's or spectrum lessee's end-to-end physical network infrastructure (e.g., base stations, mobile stations, or other related elements). In a private commons arrangement, the licensee or spectrum lessee authorizes users of certain communications devices employing particular technical parameters, as specified by the licensee or spectrum lessee, to operate under the license authorization. A private commons arrangement differs from a spectrum leasing arrangement in that, unlike spectrum leasing arrangements, a private commons arrangement does not involve individually negotiated spectrum access rights with entities that seek to provide network-based services to end-users. A private commons arrangement does not affect unlicensed operations in a particular licensed band to the extent that they are permitted pursuant to part 15.

(b) Licensee/spectrum lessee responsibilities. As the manager of any private commons, the licensee or spectrum lessee:

(1) Establishes the technical and operating terms and conditions of use by users of the private commons, including those relating to the types of communications devices that may be used within the private commons, consistent with the terms and conditions of the underlying license authorization;

(2) Retains de facto control of the use of spectrum by users within the private commons, including maintaining reasonable oversight over the users' use of the spectrum in the private commons so as to ensure that the use of the spectrum, and communications equipment employed, comply with all applicable technical and service rules (including requirements relating to radiofrequency radiation) and maintaining the ability to ensure such compliance; and,

(3) Retains direct responsibility for ensuring that the users of the private commons, and the equipment employed, comply with all applicable technical and service rules, including requirements relating to radiofrequency radiation and requirements relating to interference.

(c) Notification requirements. Prior to permitting users to commence operations within a private commons, the licensee or spectrum lessee must notify the Commission, using FCC Form 608, that it is establishing a private commons arrangement. This notification must include information that describes: the location(s) or coverage area(s) of the private commons under the license authorization; the term of the arrangement; the general terms and conditions for users that would be gaining spectrum access to the private commons; the technical requirements and equipment that the licensee or spectrum lessee has approved for use within the private commons; and, the types of communications uses that are to be allowed within the private commons.
