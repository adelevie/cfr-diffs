(a) The requirements for DSC equipment voluntarily installed in coast or ships stations are as follows:

(1) Prior to March 25, 2009, DSC equipment must meet the requirements of the following standards in order to be approved for use:

(i) RTCM Paper 56-95/SC101-STD, RTCM Recommended Minimum Standards for Digital Selective Calling (DSC) Equipment Providing Minimum Distress and Safety Capability,” Version 1.0, August 10, 1995, and ITU-R Recommendation M.493-10, “Digital Selective-calling System for Use in the Maritime Mobile Service,” with Annexes 1 and 2, 2000 (including only equipment classes A, B, D, and E); or

(ii) ITU-R Recommendation M.493-11, “Digital Selective-calling System for Use in the Maritime Mobile Service,” with Annexes 1 and 2, 2004, and, in the case of Class D DSC equipment only, IEC 62238, First edition, “Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems—VHF radiotelephone equipment incorporating Class ‘D’ Digital Selective Calling (DSC)—Methods of testing and required test results,” March 2003.

(2) Beginning March 25, 2009, the Commission will not accept new applications (but will continue to process then-pending applications) for certification of non-portable DSC equipment that does not meet the requirements of ITU-R Recommendation M.493-11, “Digital Selective-calling System for Use in the Maritime Mobile Service,” with Annexes 1 and 2, 2004, and, in the case of Class D DSC equipment only, IEC 62238, First edition, “Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems—VHF radiotelephone equipment incorporating Class ‘D’ Digital Selective Calling (DSC)—Methods of testing and required test results,” March 2003.

(3) Beginning March 25, 2012, the Commission will not accept new applications (but will continue to process then-pending applications) for certification of handheld, portable DSC equipment that does not meet the requirements of ITU-R Recommendation M.493-11, “Digital Selective-calling System for Use in the Maritime Mobile Service,” with Annexes 1 and 2, 2004, and, in the case of Class D DSC equipment only, IEC 62238, First edition, “Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems—VHF radiotelephone equipment incorporating Class ‘D’ Digital Selective Calling (DSC)—Methods of testing and required test results,” March 2003.

(4) The manufacture, importation, sale or installation of non-portable DSC equipment that does not comply with either of the standards referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is prohibited beginning March 25, 2011.

(5) The manufacture, importation, or sale of handheld, portable DSC equipment that does not comply with either of the standards referenced in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is prohibited beginning March 25, 2015.

(6) Approved DSC equipment that has been manufactured, sold, and installed in conformity with the requirements of this section may be used indefinitely.

(b) Manufacturers of Class C DSC equipment to be used on United States vessels must affix a clearly discernible permanent plate or label visible from the operating controls containing the following:
              

(c) Selective calling equipment, other than that designed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, is authorized as follows:

(1) Equipment used in conjunction with the Automated Maritime Telecommunications System (AMTS) in the band 216-220 MHz,

(2) Equipment used to perform a selective calling function during narrow-band direct-printing (NB-DP) operations in accordance with ITU-R Recommendation M.476-5, “Direct-Printing Telegraph Equipment in the Maritime Mobile Service,” with Annex, 1995, or ITU-R Recommendation M.625-3, “Direct-Printing Telegraph Equipment Employing Automatic Identification in the Maritime Mobile Service,” with Annex, 1995, ITU-R Recommendation M.493-11, “Digital Selective-calling System for Use in the Maritime Mobile Service,” with Annexes 1 and 2, 2004, and

(3) Equipment functioning under the provisions of § 80.207(a) includes the brief use of radiotelegraphy, including keying only the modulating audio frequency, tone signals, and other signalling devices to establish or maintain communications provided that:

(i) These signalling techniques are not used on frequencies designated for general purpose digital selective calling (DSC) and distress and safety DSC calling as listed in § 80.359;

(ii) The authorized radiotelephone emission bandwidth is not exceeded;

(iii) Documentation of selective calling protocols must be available to the general public; and,
              

(iv) Harmful interference is not caused to stations operating in accordance with the International Radio Regulations.
