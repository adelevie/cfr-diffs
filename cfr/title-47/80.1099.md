(a) There must be available at all times, while the ship is at sea, a supply of electrical energy sufficient to operate the radio installations and to charge any batteries used as part of a reserve source of energy for the radio installations.
                

(b) A reserve source of energy to supply radio installations must be provided on every ship for the purpose of conducting distress and safety radio-communications, in the event of failure of the ship's main and emergency sources of electrical power. The reserve sources of energy must be capable of simultaneously operating the VHF radio installation required by § 80.1085(a)(1) and, as appropriate for the sea area or sea areas for which the ship is equipped, either the MF radio installation required by § 80.1089(a)(1), the MF/HF radio installation required by § 80.1091(a)(2)(i) or § 80.1093(a), or the INMARSAT ship earth station required by § 80.1091(a)(1) and any of the additional loads mentioned in paragraphs (d), (e) and (h) of this section for a period of at least:

(1) One hour, on ships constructed on or after February 1, 1995;

(2) One hour, on ships constructed before February 1, 1995, if the emergency source of electrical power complies fully with all relevant requirements of SOLAS, Chapter II-1, Regulation 42 or 43 (as amended); or

(3) Six hours, on ships constructed before February 1, 1995, and on cargo ships of less than 500 tons gross tonnage, if the emergency source of electrical power is not provided or does not comply fully with all relevant requirements of SOLAS, Chapter II-1, Regulation 42 or 43 (as amended).

(c) The reserve sources of energy need not supply independent HF and MF radio installations at the same time. The reserve sources of energy must be independent of the propelling power of the ship and the ship's electrical system.

(d) Where, in addition to the VHF radio installation, two or more of the other radio installations, referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, can be connected to the reserve sources of energy, they must be capable of simultaneously supplying, for one hour, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the VHF radio installation and;

(1) All other radio installations which can be connected to the reserve sources of energy at the same time; or

(2) Whichever of the other radio installations will consume the most power, if only one of the other radio installations can be connected to the reserve sources of energy at the same time as the VHF radio installation.

(e) The reserve sources of energy may be used to supply the electrical lighting required by § 80.1083(b)(4).

(f) Where a reserve source of energy consists of a rechargeable accumulator battery or batteries:

(1) A means of automatically charging such batteries must be provided which must be capable of recharging them to minimum capacity requirements within 10 hours; and

(2) Battery charge levels should be checked at intervals of 30 days or less with equipment turned ON and the battery charger turned OFF. Portable equipment with primary batteries such as EPIRBs and SARTs should be checked at the same intervals using methods recommended by the manufacturer. The results of battery checks should be recorded in the radio log.

(g) The accumulator batteries which provide a reserve source of energy must be installed to ensure: The highest degree of service, a reasonable lifetime, reasonable safety; that the battery temperatures remain within the manufacturer's specifications whether under charge or idle; and that when fully charged, the batteries will provide at least the minimum required hours of operation under all weather conditions.

(h) If an uninterrupted input of information from the ship's navigational or other equipment to a radio installation required by this subpart (including the navigational receiver referred to in SOLAS Chapter IV, Regulation 18) is needed to ensure its proper performance, means must be provided to ensure the continuous supply of such information in the event of failure of the ship's main or emergency source of electrical power.

(i) An uninterruptible power supply or other means of ensuring a continuous supply of electrical power, within equipment tolerances, shall be provided to all GMDSS equipment that could be affected by normal variations and interruptions of ship's power.
