Operation in the MedRadio service is permitted by rule and without an individual license issued by the FCC. Duly authorized health care professionals are permitted to operate MedRadio transmitters. Persons may also operate MedRadio transmitters to the extent the transmitters are incorporated into implanted or body-worn medical devices that are used by the person at the direction of a duly authorized health care professional; this includes medical devices that have been implanted in that person or placed on the body of that person by or under the direction of a duly authorized health care professional. Manufacturers of medical devices that include MedRadio transmitters, and their representatives, are authorized to operate transmitters in this service for the purpose of demonstrating such equipment to duly authorized health care professionals. No entity that is a foreign government or which is acting in its capacity as a representative of a foreign government is eligible to operate a MedRadio transmitter. The term “duly authorized health care professional” means a physician or other individual authorized under state or federal law to provide health care services. Operations that comply with the requirements of this part may be conducted under manual or automatic control.
