(a) This section is applicable only to local exchange carriers that are not subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(ee) of this chapter. Until June 30, 2003, a charge that is expressed in dollars and cents per line per access minute of use shall be assessed upon all interexchange carriers that use local exchange common line facilities for the provision of interstate or foreign telecommunications services, except that the charge shall not be assessed upon interexchange carriers to the extent they resell MTS or MTS-type services of other common carriers (OCCs).

(b)(1) For purposes of this section and § 69.113:

(i) A carrier or other person shall be deemed to receive premium access if access is provided through a local exchange switch that has the capability to provide access for an MTS-WATS equivalent service that is substantially equivalent to the access provided for MTS or WATS, except that access provided for an MTS-WATS equivalent service that does not use such capability shall not be deemed to be premium access until six months after the carrier that provides such MTS-WATS equivalent service receives actual notice that such equivalent access is or will be available at such switch;

(ii) The term open end of a call describes the origination or termination of a call that utilizes exchange carrier common line plant (a call can have no, one, or two open ends); and

(iii) All open end minutes on calls with one open end (e.g., an 800 or FX call) shall be treated as terminating minutes.

(2) For association Carrier Common Line tariff participants:

(i) The premium originating Carrier Common Line charge shall be one cent per minute, except as described in § 69.105(b)(3), and

(ii) The premium terminating Carrier Common Line charge shall be computed as follows:

(A) For each telephone company subject to price cap regulation, multiply the company's proposed premium originating rate by a number equal to the sum of the premium originating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium originating base period minutes of that telephone company;

(B) For each telephone company subject to price cap regulation, multiply the company's proposed premium terminating rate by a number equal to the sum of the premium terminating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium terminating base period minutes of that telephone company;

(C) Sum the numbers computed in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section for all companies subject to price cap regulation;

(D) From the number computed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, subtract a number equal to one cent times the sum of the premium originating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium originating base period minutes of all telephone companies subject to price cap regulation, and;

(E) Divide the number computed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section by the sum of the premium terminating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the non-premium terminating base period minutes of all telephone companies subject to price cap regulation.

(3) If the calculations described in § 69.105(b)(2) result in a per minute charge on premium terminating minutes that is less than once cent, both the originating and terminating premium charges for the association CCL tariff participants shall be computed by dividing the number computed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section by a number equal to the sum of the premium originating and terminating base period minutes and a number equal to 0.45 multiplied by the sum of the non-premium originating and terminating base period minutes of all telephone companies subject to price cap regulation.

(4) The Carrier Common Line charges of telephone companies that are not association Carrier Common Line tariff participants shall be computed at the level of Carrier Common Line access element aggregation selected by such telephone companies pursuant to § 69.3(e)(7). For each such Carrier Common Line access element tariff—

(i) The premium originating Carrier Common Line charge shall be one cent per minute, and

(ii) The premium terminating Carrier Common Line charge shall be computed by subtracting the projected revenues generated by the originating Carrier Common Line charges (both premium and non-premium) from the Carrier Common Line revenue requirement for the companies participating in that tariff, and dividing the remainder by the sum of the projected premium terminating minutes and a number equal to .45 multiplied by the projected non-premium terminating minutes for such companies.

(5) If the calculations described in § 69.105(b)(4) result in a per minute charge on premium terminating minutes that is less than one cent, both the originating and terminating premium charges for the companies participating in said Carrier Common Line tariff shall be computed by dividing the projected Carrier Common Line revenue requirement for such companies by the sum of the projected premium minutes and a number equal to .45 multiplied by the projected non-premium minutes for such companies.

(6) Telephone companies that are not association Carrier Common Line tariff participants shall submit to the Commission and to the association whatever data the Commission shall determine are necessary to calculate the charges described in this section.

(c) Any interexchange carrier shall receive a credit for Carrier Common Line charges to the extent that it resells services for which these charges have already been assessed (e.g., MTS or MTS-type service of other common carriers).

(d) From July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2003, the carrier common line charge calculations pursuant to this section shall be limited to an amount equal to the number of projected residential and single-line business lines multiplied by the difference between the residential and single-line business End User Common Line rate cap and the lesser of $6.50 or the non-price cap local exchange carrier's average cost per line.
