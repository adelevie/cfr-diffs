(3) For transmitters operating in the 2360-2390 MHz band, the maximum EIRP over the frequency bands of operation shall not exceed the lesser of 1 mW or 10*log (B) dBm, where B is the 20 dB emission bandwidth in MHz.

(4) For transmitters operating in the 2390-2400 MHz band, the maximum EIRP over the frequency bands of operation shall not exceed the lesser of 20 mW or 16+10*log (B) dBm, where B is the 20 dB emission bandwidth in MHz.
