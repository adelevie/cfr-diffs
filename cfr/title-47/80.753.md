(a) The requirements for reception by a marine VHF shipboard receiver are satisfied if the field strength from the coast station, calculated in accordance with § 80.771 is at least +17 dBu above one microvolt.

(b) These field strengths, voltages and powers at the receiver input are equivalent:

(1) −132 dBW (decibels referred to 1 watt).

(2) 1.8 microvolts across 50 ohms.

(3) +17 dBu (decibels referred to 1 microvolt per meter).

(4) 7 microvolts per meter.
