The appropriate reference to the FCC Record shall be included as part of the citation to any document that has been printed in the Record. The citation should provide the volume, page number and year, in that order (e.g., 1 FCC Rcd. 1 (1986). Older documents may continue to be cited to the FCC Reports, first or second series, if they were printed in the Reports (e.g., 1 FCC 2d 1 (1965)).
