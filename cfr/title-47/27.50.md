Power measurements for transmissions by stations authorized under this section may be made either in accordance with a Commission-approved average power technique or in compliance with paragraph (d)(6) of this section. In measuring transmissions in this band using an average power technique, the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the transmission may not exceed 13 dB.

(6) Peak transmit power must be measured over any interval of continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of an rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the emission bandwidth, sensitivity, etc., so as to obtain a true peak measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the channel.

(1) Main, booster and base stations. (i) The maximum EIRP of a main, booster or base station shall not exceed 33 dBW + 10log(X/Y) dBW, where X is the actual channel width in MHz and Y is either 6 MHz if prior to transition or the station is in the MBS following transition or 5.5 MHz if the station is in the LBS and UBS following transition, except as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.

(ii) If a main or booster station sectorizes or otherwise uses one or more transmitting antennas with a non-omnidirectional horizontal plane radiation pattern, the maximum EIRP in dBW in a given direction shall be determined by the following formula: EIRP = 33 dBW + 10 log(X/Y) dBW + 10 log(360/beamwidth) dBW, where X is the actual channel width in MHz, Y is either (i) 6 MHz if prior to transition or the station is in the MBS following transition or (ii) 5.5 MHz if the station is in the LBS and UBS following transition, and beamwidth is the total horizontal plane beamwidth of the individual transmitting antenna for the station or any sector measured at the half-power points.

(2) Mobile and other user stations. Mobile stations are limited to 2.0 watts EIRP. All user stations are limited to 2.0 watts transmitter output power.

(3) For television transmission, the peak power of the accompanying aural signal must not exceed 10 percent of the peak visual power of the transmitter. The Commission may order a reduction in aural signal power to diminish the potential for harmful interference.

(4) For main, booster and response stations utilizing digital emissions with non-uniform power spectral density (e.g. unfiltered QPSK), the power measured within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within the 6 MHz channel occupied by the non-uniform emission cannot exceed the power permitted within any 100 kHz resolution bandwidth within the 6 MHz channel if it were occupied by an emission with uniform power spectral density, i.e., if the maximum permissible power of a station utilizing a perfectly uniform power spectral density across a 6 MHz channel were 2000 watts EIRP, this would result in a maximum permissible power flux density for the station of 2000/60 = 33.3 watts EIRP per 100 kHz bandwidth. If a non-uniform emission were substituted at the station, station power would still be limited to a maximum of 33.3 watts EIRP within any 100 kHz segment of the 6 MHz channel, irrespective of the fact that this would result in a total 6 MHz channel power of less than 2000 watts EIRP.

(i) Peak transmit power shall be measured over any interval of continuous transmission using instrumentation calibrated in terms of rms-equivalent voltage. The measurement results shall be properly adjusted for any instrument limitations, such as detector response times, limited resolution bandwidth capability when compared to the emission bandwidth, etc., so as to obtain a true peak measurement for the emission in question over the full bandwidth of the channel.
