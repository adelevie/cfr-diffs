(a) On any frequency in an MTA licensee's spectrum block that is adjacent to a non-MTA frequency, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 plus 10 log10(P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation.
                                

(b) When an emission outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require greater attenuation than specified in this section.
