(a) Spectrum use. The Shared Wireless Broadband Network will operate using spectrum associated with the Upper 700 MHz D Block license in the 758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz bands and the Public Safety Broadband License in the adjacent 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands.

(b) Access to spectrum in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee which holds the Public Safety Broadband License, pursuant to part 90 rules, must lease the spectrum rights associated with this license, pursuant to a spectrum manager leasing arrangement set forth in part 1 subpart X, to the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Operating Company for the entire remaining term of the Public Safety Broadband License to effectuate the 700 MHz Public/Private Partnership. The Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the Operating Company, are the only entities that are eligible to lease the spectrum usage rights associated with the Public Safety Broadband License to operate on the 763-768 and 793-798 MHz bands. If the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is cancelled, this spectrum leasing arrangement will automatically terminate.

(c) Commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. Commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands through the spectrum manager leasing arrangement shall not cause harmful interference to primary users (i.e., public safety users) and cannot claim protection from harmful interference from the primary public safety operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands. The network providing commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands through the spectrum manager leasing arrangement must be designed to automatically assign priority to public safety users, to the exclusion and/or immediate preemption of any commercial use on a dynamic, real-time priority basis, and to guarantee that public safety users suffer no harmful interference or interruption or degradation of service due to commercial operations in the 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands.
