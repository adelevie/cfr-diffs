(1) At the prehearing conference prescribed by this section, the parties to the proceeding shall be prepared to discuss the advisability of reducing any or all phases of their affirmative direct cases to written form.

(2) In hearings involving applications for new, improved and changed facilities and in comparative hearings involving only applications for new facilities, where it appears that it will contribute significantly to the disposition of the proceeding for the parties to submit all or any portion of their affirmative direct cases in writing, the presiding officer may, in his discretion, require them to do so.

(f) The presiding officer may, upon the written request of a party or parties, approve the use of a speakerphone as a means of attendance at a prehearing conference if such use is found to conduce to the proper dispatch of business and the ends of justice.
