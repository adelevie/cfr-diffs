Every vessel subject to Part III of Title III of the Communications Act must have a detailed inspection of the radio installation by an FCC-licensed technician in accordance with § 80.59 once every five years. The FCC-licensed technician must use the latest FCC Information Bulletin, How to Conduct an Inspection of a Small Passenger Vessel. If the ship passes the inspection, the technician will issue a Communications Act Safety Radiotelephony Certificate. Communications Act Radiotelephony Certificates may be obtained from the Commission's National Call Center—(888) 225-5322—or from its forms contractor.
