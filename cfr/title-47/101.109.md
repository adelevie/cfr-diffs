(a) Each authorization issued pursuant to these rules will show, as the emission designator, a symbol representing the class of emission which must be prefixed by a number specifying the necessary bandwidth. This figure does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth actually occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where part 2 of this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of the necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth may be used in the emission designator.

(b) Stations in this service will be authorized any type of emission, method of modulation, and transmission characteristic, consistent with efficient use of the spectrum and good engineering practice, except that Type B, damped-wave emission will not be authorized.

(c) The maximum bandwidth which will be authorized per frequency assigned is set out in the table that follows. Regardless of the maximum authorized bandwidth specified for each frequency band, the Commission reserves the right to issue a license for less than the maximum bandwidth if it appears that a lesser bandwidth would be sufficient to support an applicant's intended communications.
