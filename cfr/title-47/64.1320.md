(1) With the Commission's Secretary in CC Docket No. 96-128;

(3) With each facilities-based long distance carrier from which it receives payphone calls.

(c) The Completing Carrier must comply with, and the third-party auditor must verify, the Completing Carrier's compliance with the following factors in establishing a call tracking system pursuant to § 64.1310(a)(1):

(e) At the time of filing of a System Audit Report with the Commission, the Completing Carrier shall file with the Commission's Secretary, the payphone service providers and the facilities-based long distance carriers identified in paragraph (b) of this section, a statement that includes the name of the Completing Carrier, and the name, address and phone number for the person or persons responsible for handling the Completing Carrier's payphone compensation and for resolving disputes with payphone service providers over compensation, and this statement shall be updated within 60 days of any changes of such persons. If a Completing Carrier chooses to notify payphone service providers of this statement and its System Audit Report by posting these two documents on its website or a clearinghouse website, then this statement shall include the web address for these two documents.

(f) One year after the filing of the System Audit Report, and annually thereafter, the Completing Carrier shall engage an independent third-party auditor to:

(2) If a material change has occurred concerning the Completing Carrier's compliance with the prior year's System Audit Report, verify that the material changes do not affect compliance with the audit criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
