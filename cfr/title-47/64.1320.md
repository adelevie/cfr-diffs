If a Completing Carrier chooses to notify payphone service providers of this statement and its System Audit Report by posting these two documents on its website or a clearinghouse website, then this statement shall include the web address for these two documents.

(f) One year after the filing of the System Audit Report, and annually thereafter, the Completing Carrier shall engage an independent third-party auditor to:
