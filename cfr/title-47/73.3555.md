(a)(1) Local radio ownership rule. A person or single entity (or entities under common control) may have a cognizable interest in licenses for AM or FM radio broadcast stations in accordance with the following limits:

(i) In a radio market with 45 or more full-power, commercial and noncommercial radio stations, not more than 8 commercial radio stations in total and not more than 5 commercial stations in the same service (AM or FM);

(ii) In a radio market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive) full-power, commercial and noncommercial radio stations, not more than 7 commercial radio stations in total and not more than 4 commercial stations in the same service (AM or FM);

(iii) In a radio market with between 15 and 29 (inclusive) full-power, commercial and noncommercial radio stations, not more than 6 commercial radio stations in total and not more than 4 commercial stations in the same service (AM or FM); and

(iv) In a radio market with 14 or fewer full-power, commercial and noncommercial radio stations, not more than 5 commercial radio stations in total and not more than 3 commercial stations in the same service (AM or FM); provided, however, that no person or single entity (or entities under common control) may have a cognizable interest in more than 50% of the full-power, commercial and noncommercial radio stations in such market unless the combination of stations comprises not more than one AM and one FM station.

(2) Overlap between two stations in different services is permissible if neither of those two stations overlaps a third station in the same service.

(b) Local television multiple ownership rule. An entity may directly or indirectly own, operate, or control two television stations licensed in the same Designated Market Area (DMA) (as determined by Nielsen Media Research or any successor entity) only under one or more of the following conditions:

(1) The Grade B contours of the stations (as determined by § 73.684) do not overlap; or

(i) At the time the application to acquire or construct the station(s) is filed, at least one of the stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA, based on the most recent all-day (9 a.m.-midnight) audience share, as measured by Nielsen Media Research or by any comparable professional, accepted audience ratings service; and

(ii) At least 8 independently owned and operating, full-power commercial and noncommercial TV stations would remain post-merger in the DMA in which the communities of license of the TV stations in question are located. Count only those stations the Grade B signal contours of which overlap with the Grade B signal contour of at least one of the stations in the proposed combination. In areas where there is no Nielsen DMA, count the TV stations present in an area that would be the functional equivalent of a TV market. Count only those TV stations the Grade B signal contours of which overlap with the Grade B signal contour of at least one of the stations in the proposed combination.

(2) [Reserved]
                      

(c) Radio-television cross-ownership rule—(1) This rule is triggered when: (i) The predicted or measured 1 mV/m contour of an existing or proposed FM station (computed in accordance with § 73.313) encompasses the entire community of license of an existing or proposed commonly owned TV broadcast station(s), or the Grade A contour(s) of the TV broadcast station(s) (computed in accordance with § 73.684) encompasses the entire community of license of the FM station; or

(ii) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m groundwave contour of an existing or proposed AM station (computed in accordance with § 73.183 or § 73.386), encompasses the entire community of license of an existing or proposed commonly owned TV broadcast station(s), or the Grade A contour(s) of the TV broadcast station(s) (computed in accordance with § 73.684) encompass(es) the entire community of license of the AM station.

(2) An entity may directly or indirectly own, operate, or control up to two commercial TV stations (if permitted by paragraph (b) of this section, the local television multiple ownership rule) and 1 commercial radio station situated as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. An entity may not exceed these numbers, except as follows:

(i) If at least 20 independently owned media voices would remain in the market post-merger, an entity can directly or indirectly own, operate, or control up to:

(A) Two commercial TV and six commercial radio stations (to the extent permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, the local radio multiple ownership rule); or

(B) One commercial TV and seven commercial radio stations (to the extent that an entity would be permitted to own two commercial TV and six commercial radio stations under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, and to the extent permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, the local radio multiple ownership rule).

(ii) If at least 10 independently owned media voices would remain in the market post-merger, an entity can directly or indirectly own, operate, or control up to two commercial TV and four commercial radio stations (to the extent permitted by paragraph (a) of this section, the local radio multiple ownership rule).

(3) To determine how many media voices would remain in the market, count the following:

(i) TV stations: independently owned and operating full-power broadcast TV stations within the DMA of the TV station's (or stations') community (or communities) of license that have Grade B signal contours that overlap with the Grade B signal contour(s) of the TV station(s) at issue;

(ii) Radio stations: (A)(1) Independently owned operating primary broadcast radio stations that are in the radio metro market (as defined by Arbitron or another nationally recognized audience rating service) of:

(i) The TV station's (or stations') community (or communities) of license; or

(ii) The radio station's (or stations') community (or communities) of license; and

(2) Independently owned out-of-market broadcast radio stations with a minimum share as reported by Arbitron or another nationally recognized audience rating service.

(B) When a proposed combination involves stations in different radio markets, the voice requirement must be met in each market; the radio stations of different radio metro markets may not be counted together.

(C) In areas where there is no radio metro market, count the radio stations present in an area that would be the functional equivalent of a radio market.

(iii) Newspapers: Newspapers that are published at least four days a week within the TV station's DMA in the dominant language of the market and that have a circulation exceeding 5% of the households in the DMA; and

(iv) One cable system: if cable television is generally available to households in the DMA. Cable television counts as only one voice in the DMA, regardless of how many individual cable systems operate in the DMA.

(d) Daily newspaper cross-ownership rule. (1) No license for an AM, FM or TV broadcast station shall be granted to any party (including all parties under common control) if such party directly or indirectly owns, operates or controls a daily newspaper and the grant of such license will result in:

(i) The predicted or measured 2 mV/m contour of an AM station, computed in accordance with § 73.183 or § 73.186, encompassing the entire community in which such newspaper is published; or

(ii) The predicted 1 mV/m contour for an FM station, computed in accordance with § 73.313, encompassing the entire community in which such newspaper is published; or

(iii) The Grade A contour of a TV station, computed in accordance with § 73.684, encompassing the entire community in which such newspaper is published.

(2) Paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply in cases where the Commission makes a finding pursuant to Section 310(d) of the Communications Act that the public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served by permitting an entity that owns, operates or controls a daily newspaper to own, operate or control an AM, FM, or TV broadcast station whose relevant contour encompasses the entire community in which such newspaper is published as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(3) In making a finding under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, there shall be a presumption that it is not inconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity for an entity to own, operate or control a daily newspaper in a top 20 Nielsen DMA and one commercial AM, FM or TV broadcast station whose relevant contour encompasses the entire community in which such newspaper is published as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, provided that, with respect to a combination including a commercial TV station,

(i) The station is not ranked among the top four TV stations in the DMA, based on the most recent all-day (9 a.m.-midnight) audience share, as measured by Nielsen Media Research or by any comparable professional, accepted audience ratings service; and

(ii) At least 8 independently owned and operating major media voices would remain in the DMA in which the community of license of the TV station in question is located (for purposes of this provision major media voices include full-power TV broadcast stations and major newspapers).

(4) In making a finding under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, there shall be a presumption that it is inconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity for an entity to own, operate or control a daily newspaper and an AM, FM or TV broadcast station whose relevant contour encompasses the entire community in which such newspaper is published as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section in a DMA other than the top 20 Nielsen DMAs or in any circumstance not covered under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(5) In making a finding under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Commission shall consider:

(i) Whether the combined entity will significantly increase the amount of local news in the market;

(ii) Whether the newspaper and the broadcast outlets each will continue to employ its own staff and each will exercise its own independent news judgment;

(iii) The level of concentration in the Nielsen Designated Market Area (DMA); and

(iv) The financial condition of the newspaper or broadcast station, and if the newspaper or broadcast station is in financial distress, the proposed owner's commitment to invest significantly in newsroom operations.

(6) In order to overcome the negative presumption set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section with respect to the combination of a major newspaper and a television station, the applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that the co-owned major newspaper and station will increase the diversity of independent news outlets and increase competition among independent news sources in the market, and the factors set forth above in paragraph (d)(5) of this section will inform this decision.

(7) The negative presumption set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section shall be reversed under the following two circumstances:

(i) The newspaper or broadcast station is failed or failing; or
                      

(ii) The combination is with a broadcast station that was not offering local newscasts prior to the combination, and the station will initiate at least seven hours per week of local news programming after the combination.

(e) National television multiple ownership rule. (1) No license for a commercial television broadcast station shall be granted, transferred or assigned to any party (including all parties under common control) if the grant, transfer or assignment of such license would result in such party or any of its stockholders, partners, members, officers or directors having a cognizable interest in television stations which have an aggregate national audience reach exceeding thirty-nine (39) percent.

(2) For purposes of this paragraph (e):

(i) National audience reach means the total number of television households in the Nielsen Designated Market Areas (DMAs) in which the relevant stations are located divided by the total national television households as measured by DMA data at the time of a grant, transfer, or assignment of a license. For purposes of making this calculation, UHF television stations shall be attributed with 50 percent of the television households in their DMA market.

(ii) No market shall be counted more than once in making this calculation.

(3) Divestiture. A person or entity that exceeds the thirty-nine (39) percent national audience reach limitation for television stations in paragraph (e)(1) of this section through grant, transfer, or assignment of an additional license for a commercial television broadcast station shall have not more than 2 years after exceeding such limitation to come into compliance with such limitation. This divestiture requirement shall not apply to persons or entities that exceed the 39 percent national audience reach limitation through population growth.

(f) The ownership limits of this section are not applicable to noncommercial educational FM and noncommercial educational TV stations. However, the attribution standards set forth in the Notes to this section will be used to determine attribution for noncommercial educational FM and TV applicants, such as in evaluating mutually exclusive applications pursuant to subpart K of part 73.
