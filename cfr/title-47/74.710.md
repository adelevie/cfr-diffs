(a) An application to construct a new low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station or change the facilities of an existing station will not be accepted if it fails to protect an authorized digital low power TV or TV translator station or an application for such station filed prior to the date the low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster application is filed.

(b) Applications for low power TV, TV translator and TV booster stations shall protect digital low power TV and TV translator stations pursuant to the following requirements:

(1) An application must not specify an antenna site within the protected contour of a co-channel or adjacent channel digital low power TV or TV translator station, as defined in § 74.792.

(2) The ratio in dB of the field strength of the low power TV, TV translator or TV booster station at the protected contour of a co-channel digital TV or TV translator station must meet the requirements specified in § 74.706(d)(1).

(3) The ratio in dB of the field strength of the low power TV, TV translator or TV booster station at the protected contour of a digital low power TV or TV translator station on the lower and upper adjacent channels must not exceed 49 dB and 48 dB, respectively.

(4) The analysis used in 74.710 should use the propagation methods specified in § 74.706(c).

(c) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, an applicant for a low power TV, TV translator or TV booster may make full use of terrain shielding and Longley-Rice terrain dependent propagation prediction methods to demonstrate that the proposed facility would not be likely to cause interference to digital low power TV or TV translator stations, as described in § 74.707(e) (i.e., reduce the service population by no more than 0.5% within the station's protected contour based on the interference thresholds of § 73.623(c) of this chapter).
