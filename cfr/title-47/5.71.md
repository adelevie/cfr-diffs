(a) The regular license period for stations in the Experimental Radio Service is either 2 or 5 years. An applicant desiring to apply for a 5-year license must provide justification for its need for a license of that duration. A license may be renewed upon an adequate showing of need.

(b) A license will not be granted for a period longer than that which is required for completion of the experimental project. If such period is estimated to be less than 2 years, or between 2-5 years, a statement to that effect by the applicant may facilitate grant of the application. See also ยง 5.69 of this part.
