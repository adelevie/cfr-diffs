The cost-sharing plan will sunset for all AWS and MSS (including MSS/ATC) entities on the same date on which the relocation obligation for the subject AWS band (i.e., 2110-2150 MHz, 2160-2175 MHz, or 2175-2180 MHz) in which the relocated FMS link was located terminates. AWS or MSS (including MSS/ATC) entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation prior to the sunset date must satisfy their payment obligation in full.
