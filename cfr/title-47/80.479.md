(a) The frequencies assignable to AMTS stations are listed in subpart H of this subpart.

(b) The transmissions from a station of an AMTS geographic area licensee may not exceed a predicted 38 dBu field strength at the geographic area border, unless all affected co-channel geographic area licensees agree to the higher field strength. The predicted 38 dBu field strength is calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for Channels 7 through 13 in ยง 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a 9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential. Geographic area licensees must coordinate to minimize interference at or near their geographic area borders, and must cooperate to resolve any instances of interference in accordance with the provisions of ยง 80.70(a).

(c) AMTS frequencies may be used for mobile-to-mobile communications if written consent is obtained from all affected licensees.
