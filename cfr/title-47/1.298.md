(a) Unless it is found that irreparable injury would thereby be caused one of the parties, or that the public interest requires otherwise, or unless all parties have consented to the contrary, consideration of interlocutory requests will be withheld until the time for filing oppositions (and replies, if replies are allowed) has expired. As a matter of discretion, however, requests for continuances and extensions of time, requests for permission to file pleadings in excess of the length prescribed in this chapter, and requests for temporary relief may be ruled upon ex parte without waiting for the filing of responsive pleadings.

(b) In the discretion of the presiding officer, rulings on interlocutory matters may be made orally at the hearing. The presiding officer may, in his discretion, state his reasons on the record or subsequently issue a written statement of the reasons for his ruling, either separately or as part of the initial decision.
