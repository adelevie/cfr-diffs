(a) The following channel center frequencies are permitted to be aggregated for channel bandwidths of 5, 10, 15 or 20 MHz as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Channel numbers 1 through 5 and 14 through 18 are 1 MHz bandwidth channels, and channel numbers 6 through 13 are 5 MHz bandwidth channels.

(b) The following tables list center frequencies to be licensed for aggregated channels only. A license may contain any combination of bandwidths from aggregated channels provided that the bandwidths do not overlap. The bandwidth edges (lower and upper frequencies) are provided to aid in planning.

(1) 5 MHz bandwidth aggregation:

(2) 10 MHz bandwidth aggregation:

(3) 15 MHz bandwidth aggregation:

(4) 20 MHz bandwidth aggregation:
