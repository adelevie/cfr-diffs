(a) While at sea, all ships must maintain a continuous watch:

(1) On VHF DSC channel 70, if the ship is fitted with a VHF radio installation in accordance with § 80.1085(a)(2);

(2) On the distress and safety DSC frequency 2187.5 kHz, if the ship is fitted with an MF radio installation in accordance with § 80.1089(a)(2) or § 80.1091(a)(3);

(3) On the distress and safety DSC frequencies 2187.5 kHz and 8414.5 kHz also on at least one of the distress and safety DSC frequencies 4207.5 kHz, 6312 kHz, 12577 kHz, or 16804.5 kHz appropriate to the time of day and the geographical position of the ship, if the ship is fitted with an MF/HF radio installation in accordance with § 80.1091(a)(2)(ii) or § 80.1093(a) of this part (this watch may be kept by means of a scanning receiver limited to six distress and safety DSC frequencies); and

(4) For satellite shore-to-ship distress alert, if the ship is fitted with an INMARSAT ship earth station in accordance with § 80.1091(a)(1).

(b) While at sea, all ships must maintain radio watches for broadcasts of maritime safety information on the appropriate frequency or frequencies on which such information is broadcast for the area in which the ship is navigating.

(c) Every ship while at sea must maintain, when practicable, a continuous listening watch on VHF Channel 16. This watch must be kept at the position from which the ship is normally navigated or at a position which is continuously manned.

(d) On receipt of a distress alert transmitted by use of digital selective calling techniques, ship stations must set watch on the radiotelephone distress and safety traffic frequency associated with the distress and safety calling frequency on which the distress alert was received.

(e) Ship stations with narrow-band direct printing equipment must set watch on the narrow-band direct-printing frequency associated with the distress alert signal if it indicates that narrow-band direct-printing is to be used for subsequent distress communications. If practicable, they should additionally set watch on the radiotelephone frequency associated with the distress alert frequency.
