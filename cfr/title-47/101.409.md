(a) Developmental authorizations normally will be issued for one year, or such shorter term as the Commission may deem appropriate in any particular case, and will be subject to cancellation without hearing by the Commission at any time upon notice to the licensee.

(b) Where some phases of the developmental program are not covered by the general rules of the Commission or by the rules of this part, the Commission may specify supplemental or additional requirements or conditions in each case as it may deem necessary in the public interest, convenience or necessity.

(c) Frequencies allocated to the service toward which such development is directed will be assigned for developmental operation on the basis that no interference will be caused to the regular services of stations operating in accordance with the Commission's Table of Frequency Allocations (ยง 2.106 of this chapter).

(d) The rendition of communication service for hire is not permitted under any developmental authorizations unless specifically authorized by the Commission.

(e) The grant of a developmental authorization carries with it no assurance that the developmental program, if successful, will be authorized on a permanent basis either as to the service involved or the use of the frequencies assigned or any other frequencies.
