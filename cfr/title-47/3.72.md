(8) Providing false or incomplete information to the Commission or failure to comply with or respond to requests for information.

(b) Prior to taking any of the enforcement actions in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will give notice of its intent to take the specified action and the grounds therefor, and afford a 30-day period for a response in writing; provided that, where the public interest so requires, the Commission may temporarily suspend a certification pending completion of these procedures.
