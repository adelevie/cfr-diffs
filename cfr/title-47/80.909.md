(a) The medium frequency transmitter must have a peak envelope output power of at least 60 watts for J3E emission on 2182 kHz and at least one ship-to-shore working frequency within the band 1605 to 2850 kHz enabling communication with a public coast station if the region in which the vessel is navigated is served by a public coast station operating in this band.

(b) The single sideband radiotelephone must be capable of operating on maritime frequencies in the band 1710 to 27500 kHz with a peak envelope output power of at least 120 watts for J3E emission on 2182 kHz and J3E emission on the distress and safety frequencies listed in ยง 80.369(b).

(c) The transmitter complies with the power output requirements specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section when:

(1) The transmitter can be adjusted for efficient use with an actual ship station transmitting antenna meeting the requirements of ยง 80.923 of this part; and

(2) The transmitter, with normal operating voltages applied, has been demonstrated to deliver its required output power on the frequencies specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section into either an artificial antenna consisting of a series network of 10 ohms effective resistance and 200 picofarads capacitance or an artificial antenna of 50 ohms nominal impedance. An individual demonstration of power output capability of the transmitter, with the radiotelephone installation normally installed on board ship, may be required.

(d) The single sideband radiotelephone must be capable of transmitting clearly perceptible signals from ship to shore. The transmitter complies with this requirement if it is capable of enabling communication with a public coast station on working frequencies in the 4000 to 27500 kHz band specified in ยง 80.371(b) of this part under normal daytime operating conditions.
