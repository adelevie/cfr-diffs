States that desire non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers and/or eligible telecommunications carriers serving lines in the service area of a non-rural incumbent local exchange carrier within their jurisdiction to receive support pursuant to §§ 54.309 and/or 54.311 must file an annual certification with the Administrator and the Commission stating that all federal high-cost support provided to such carriers within that State will be used only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. Support provided pursuant to §§ 54.309 and/or 54.311 shall only be provided to the extent that the State has filed the requisite certification pursuant to this section.

(b) Carriers not subject to State jurisdiction. A non-rural incumbent local exchange carrier not subject to the jurisdiction of a state or an eligible telecommunications carrier not subject to the jurisdiction of a state serving lines in the service area of a non-rural incumbent local exchange carrier that desires to receive support pursuant to §§ 54.309 and/or 54.311 of this subpart must file an annual certification with the Administrator and the Commission stating that all federal high-cost support provided to such carriers will be used only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. Support provided pursuant to §§ 54.309 and/or 54.311 of this subpart shall only be provided to the extent that the carrier has filed the requisite certification pursuant to this section.

(c) Certification format. A certification pursuant to this section may be filed in the form of a letter from the appropriate regulatory authority for the State, and must be filed with both the Office of the Secretary of the Commission clearly referencing CC Docket No. 96-45, and with the Administrator of the high-cost universal service support mechanism, on or before the deadlines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

A State may file a supplemental certification for carriers not subject to the State's annual certification. All certificates filed by a State pursuant to this section shall become part of the public record maintained by the Commission.
