(a) An AM station may operate during the experimental period (the time between midnight and sunrise, local time) on its assigned frequency and with its authorized power for the routine testing and maintenance of its transmitting system, and for conducting experimentation under an experimental authorization, provided no interference is caused to other stations maintaining a regular operating schedule within such period.

(b) No station licensed for “daytime” or “specified hours” of operation may broadcast any regular or scheduled program during this period.

(c) The licensee of an AM station shall operate or refrain from operating its station during the experimental period as directed by the FCC to facilitate frequency measurements or for the determination of interference.
