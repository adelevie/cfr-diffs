(a) For purposes of ยง 76.505(d)(2), the Commission will determine whether use of a cable operator's facilities by a local exchange carrier is reasonably limited in scope and duration according to the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Based on the record created by ยง 76.1617 of the rules, the Commission shall determine whether the local exchange carrier's use of that part of the transmission facilities of a cable system extending from the last multi-use terminal to the premises of the end user is reasonably limited in scope and duration. In making this determination, the Commission will evaluate whether the proposed joint use of cable facilities promotes competition in both services and facilities, and encourages long-term investment in telecommunications infrastructure.
