(a) Purpose. The TV bands database serves the following functions:

(1) To determine and provide to a TVBD, upon request, the available TV channels at the TVBD's location. Available channels are determined based on the interference protection requirements in § 15.712.

(2) To register the identification information and location of fixed TVBDs.

(3) To register protected locations and channels as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that are not otherwise recorded in Commission licensing databases.

(b) Information in the TV bands database. (1) Facilities already recorded in Commission databases. Identifying and location information will come from the official Commission database. These services include:

(i) Digital television stations.

(ii) Class A television stations.

(iii) Low power television stations.

(iv) Television translator and booster stations.

(v) Broadcast Auxiliary Service stations (including receive only sites), except low power auxiliary stations.

(vi) Private land mobile radio service stations.

(vii) Commercial mobile radio service stations.

(viii) Offshore radiotelephone service stations.

(2) Facilities that are not recorded in Commission databases. Identifying and location information will be entered into the TV bands database in accordance with the procedures established by the TV bands database administrator(s). These include:

(i) Cable television headends.

(ii) Class A television station receive sites.

(iii) Low power television station receive sites.

(iv) Television translator station receive sites.

(v) Sites where low power auxiliary stations, including wireless microphones and wireless assist video devices, are used and their schedule for operation.

(vi) Fixed TVBD registrations.

(c) Restrictions on registration. (1) Television translator, low power TV and Class A station receive sites within the protected contour of the station being received are not eligible for registration in the database.

(2) Cable television headends within the protected contour of a television channel are not eligible to register that channel in the database.

(d) Determination of available channels. The TV bands database will determine the available channels at a location using the interference protection requirements of § 15.712, the location information supplied by a TVBD, and the data for protected stations/locations in the database. The TV bands database will also check for proximity of a TVBD to the Canadian and Mexican borders where operation may be prohibited pursuant to § 15.712(g).

(e) TVBD initialization. (1) Fixed and Mode II TVBDs must provide their location and required identifying information to the TV bands database in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) Fixed and Mode II TVBDs shall not transmit unless they receive, from the TV bands database, a list of available channels.

(3) Fixed TVBDs register and receive a list of available channels from the database by connecting to the Internet, either directly or through another fixed TVBD.

(4) Mode II TVBDs register and receive a list of available channels from the database by connecting to the Internet, either directly or through a fixed TVBD.

(f) Fixed TVBD registration. (1) Prior to operating for the first time or after changing location, a fixed TVBD must register with the TV bands database by providing the information listed in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
              

(2) The party responsible for a fixed TVBD must ensure that the TVBD registration database has the most current, up-to-date information for that device.

(3) The TVBD registration database shall contain the following information for fixed TVBDs:

(i) FCC identifier (FCC ID) of the device.

(ii) Manufacturer's serial number of the device.

(iii) Device's geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude (NAD 83) accurate to ± 50 m).

(iv) Name of the individual or business that is responsible for the device.

(v) Name of a contact person responsible for the device's operation.

(vi) Address for the contact person.

(vii) E-mail address for the contact person.

(viii) Phone number for the contact person.

(g) A personal/portable device operating in Mode II shall provide the database its FCC Identifier (as required by § 2.926 of this chapter), serial number as assigned by the manufacturer, and the device's geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude (NAD 83) accurate to ±50 m)

(h) The TV bands database shall contain the listed information for each of the following:

(1) Digital television stations, digital and analog Class A, low power, translator and booster stations:

(i) Transmitter coordinates (latitude and longitude in NAD 83).

(ii) Effective radiated power (ERP).

(iii) Height above average terrain of the transmitting antenna (HAAT).

(iv) Horizontal transmit antenna pattern (if the antenna is directional).

(v) Channel number.

(vi) Station call sign.

(2) Broadcast Auxiliary Service.

(i) Transmitter coordinates (latitude and longitude in NAD 83).

(ii) Receiver coordinates (latitude and longitude in NAD 83).

(iii) Channel number.

(iv) Call sign.

(3) Metropolitan areas listed in § 90.303(a) of this chapter.

(i) Region name.

(ii) Channel(s) reserved for use in the region.

(iii) Geographic center of the region (latitude and longitude in NAD 83).

(iv) Call sign.

(4) PLMRS/CMRS base station operations located more than 80 km from the geographic centers of the 13 metropolitan areas defined in § 90.303(a) of this chapter (e.g., in accordance with a waiver).

(i) Transmitter location (latitude and longitude in NAD 83) or geographic area of operations.

(ii) Effective radiated power.

(iii) Transmitter height above average terrain (if specified).

(iv) Antenna height above ground level (if specified).

(v) Call sign.

(5) Offshore Radiotelephone Service. For each of the four regions where the Offshore Radiotelephone Service operates.

(i) Geographic boundaries of the region (latitude and longitude in NAD 83 for each point defining the boundary of the region.

(ii) Channel(s) used by the service in that region.

(6) Cable Television headends.

(i) Name and address of cable company.

(ii) Location of the headend receiver (latitude and longitude in NAD 83, accurate to ±50 m).

(iii) Channel number of each television channel received, subject to the following condition: channels for which the cable headend is located within the protected contour of that channel's transmitting station are not eligible for registration in the database.

(iv) Call sign of each television channel received and eligible for registration.
