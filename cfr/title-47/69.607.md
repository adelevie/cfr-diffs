If such a company has a positive net balance, the association shall disburse that amount to such company.

(b) The net balance for such a company shall be computed by multiplying a hypothetical net balance for such a company by a factor that is computed by dividing the Carrier Common Line residue by the sum of the hypothetical net balances for such companies.

(c) The hypothetical net balance for each company shall be the sum of the hypothetical net balances for each access element. Such hypothetical net balances shall be computed in accordance with §§ 69.608 to 69.610.
