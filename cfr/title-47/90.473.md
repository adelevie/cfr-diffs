An internal transmitter control system may be operated under the control and supervision of a control operator stationed at a fixed control point in the system. In such a case, the control point must be equipped to permit the control operator to monitor all traffic to and from fixed positions and mobile stations or paging units of the licensee; and the system shall be so designed to permit the control operator to either disconnect any operating position in the internal system from the transmitter control circuit or to close the system down entirely at will.
