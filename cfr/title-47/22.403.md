The provisions and requirements of this section are applicable to all developmental authorizations.

(a) Developmental authorizations are granted subject to the condition that they may be cancelled by the FCC at any time, upon notice to the licensee, and without the opportunity for a hearing.

(b) Except as otherwise indicated in this subpart, developmental authorizations normally terminate one year from the date of grant. The FCC may, however, specify a different term.

(c) Stations operating under developmental authorizations must not interfere with the services of regularly authorized stations.

(d) A grant of a developmental authorization does not provide any assurance that the FCC will grant an application for regular authorization to operate the same transmitter(s), even if operation during the developmental period has not caused interference and/or the developmental program is successful.
