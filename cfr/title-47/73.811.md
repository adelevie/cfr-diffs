(a) LP100 stations: (1) Maximum facilities. LP100 stations will be authorized to operate with maximum facilities of 100 watts effective radiated power (ERP) at 30 meters antenna height above average terrain (HAAT). An LP100 station with a HAAT that exceeds 30 meters will not be permitted to operate with an ERP greater than that which would result in a 60 dBu contour of 5.6 kilometers. In no event will an ERP less than one watt be authorized. No facility will be authorized in excess of one watt ERP at 450 meters HAAT.

(2) Minimum facilities. LP100 stations may not operate with facilities less than 50 watts ERP at 30 meters HAAT or the equivalent necessary to produce a 60 dBu contour that extends at least 4.7 kilometers.

(b) LP10 stations: (1) Maximum Facilities. LP10 stations will be authorized to operate with maximum facilities of 10 watts ERP at 30 meters HAAT. An LP10 station with a HAAT that exceeds 30 meters will not be permitted to operate with an ERP greater than that which would result in a 60 dBu contour of 3.2 kilometers. In no event will an ERP less than one watt be authorized. No facility will be authorized in excess of one watt ERP at 100 meters HAAT.

(2) Minimum Facilities. LP10 stations may not operate with less than one watt ERP.
