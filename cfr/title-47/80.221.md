(a) Each device for automatically generating the radiotelephone alarm signal must be capable of being disabled to permit the immediate transmission of a distress call and message.

(b) The device must comply with the following requirements:

(1) The frequency tolerance of each tone must be ±1.5 percent;

(2) The duration tolerance of each tone must be ±50 milliseconds;

(3) The interval between successive tones must not exceed 50 milliseconds; and

(4) The amplitude ratio of the tones must be flat within 1.6 dB.

(c) Devices installed on or after January 1, 1983, must comply with the following requirements:

(1) The frequency tolerance of each tone must be ±1.5 percent;

(2) The duration tolerance of each tone must be ±10 milliseconds;

(3) The interval between successive tones must not exceed 4 milliseconds;

(4) The amplitude ratio of the tones must be flat within 1.6 dB;

(5) The output of the device must be sufficient to modulate the associated transmitter for H2B emission to at least 70 percent, and for J2B emission to within 3 dB of the rated peak envelope power;

(6) Light from the device must not interfere with the safe navigation of the ship;

(7) After activation the device must automatically generate the radiotelephone alarm signal for not less than 30 seconds and not more than 60 seconds unless manually interrupted;

(8) After generating the radiotelephone alarm signal or after manual interruption the device must be immediately ready to repeat the signal;

(9) The transmitter must be automatically switched from the stand-by condition to the transmit condition at the start and return to the stand-by condition at the conclusion of the radiotelephone alarm signal.
              

(d) Any device used by a station to automatically generate the radiotelephone alarm signal must be certificated by the Commission.
