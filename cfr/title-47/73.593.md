The licensee of a noncommercial educational FM station is not required to use its subcarrier capacity, but if it chooses to do so, it is governed by §§ 73.293 through 73.295 of the Commission's Rules regarding the types of permissible subcarrier uses and the manner in which subcarrier operations shall be conducted; Provided, however, that remunerative use of a station's subcarrier capacity shall not be detrimental to the provision of existing or potential radio reading services for the blind or otherwise inconsistent with its public broadcasting responsibilities.
