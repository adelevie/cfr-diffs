The Commission's Rules require that the peak efficetive radiated power (PERP) of a Class A, B or S EPIRB not be less than 75 mW under certain specified conditions. The PERP of an EPIRB transmitter is determined by comparing its level to a reference PERP generated by a standard quarter-wave monopole antenna located on a one wavelength minimum diameter metal ground plane. The Rules also require that all spurious and harmonic emissions be attenuated by a specified amount with respect to the reference PERP. In addition, there is a limit on the PERP of radiated emissions with the switch in the test mode. These measurements are to be made in accordance with the following procedure.

(a) General set-up instructions. Measurements of radiated electromagnetic emissions (EME) are to be performed on the 30 meter open field test site described in ยง 2.1503(a) of this part and on one of the pair of frequencies listed in ยง 2.1507 of this part. A receiver, tuned dipole antennas and a calibrated signal generator as described in ยง 2.1505 of this part are required. The EPIRB should be powered by its own internal battery with its standard antenna attached and deployed.

(b) Set-up for radiated EME tests.
                                    
                                    

(c) Radiated EME tests.
