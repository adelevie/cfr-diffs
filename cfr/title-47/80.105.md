Each coast station or marine-utility station must acknowledge and receive all calls directed to it by ship or aircraft stations. Such stations are permitted to transmit safety communication to any ship or aircraft station. VHF (156-162 MHz) and AMTS (216-220 MHz) public coast stations may provide fixed or hybrid services on a co-primary basis with mobile operations.
