(a) Analog and digital broadcast stations may additionally transmit EAS messages through other communications means. For example, on a voluntary basis, FM stations may use subcarriers to transmit the EAS codes including 57 kHz using the RBDS standard produced by the National Radio Systems Committee (NRSC) and television stations may use subsidiary communications services.

(b) Other technologies and public service providers, such as low earth orbiting satellites, that wish to participate in the EAS may contact the FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau or their State Emergency Communications Committee for information and guidance.
