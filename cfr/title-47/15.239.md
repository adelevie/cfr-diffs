(a) Emissions from the intentional radiator shall be confined within a band 200 kHz wide centered on the operating frequency. The 200 kHz band shall lie wholly within the frequency range of 88-108 MHz.

(b) The field strength of any emissions within the permitted 200 kHz band shall not exceed 250 microvolts/meter at 3 meters. The emission limit in this paragraph is based on measurement instrumentation employing an average detector. The provisions in ยง 15.35 for limiting peak emissions apply.

(c) The field strength of any emissions radiated on any frequency outside of the specified 200 kHz band shall not exceed the general radiated emission limits in ยง 15.209.

(d) A custom built telemetry intentional radiator operating in the frequency band 88-108 MHz and used for experimentation by an educational institute need not be certified provided the device complies with the standards in this part and the educational institution notifies the Engineer in Charge of the local FCC office, in writing, in advance of operation, providing the following information:

(1) The dates and places where the device will be operated;

(2) The purpose for which the device will be used;

(3) A description of the device, including the operating frequency, RF power output, and antenna; and,

(4) A statement that the device complies with the technical provisions of this part.
