(a) Terminal equipment and protective circuitry that is subject to a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity or that is certified by a Telecommunications Certification Body shall have labels in a place and manner required by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments.

(b) Terminal equipment labels shall include an identification numbering system in a manner required by the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments.
              

(c) If the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments chooses to continue the practice of utilizing a designated “FCC” number, it shall include in its labeling requirements a warning that the Commission no longer directly approves or registers terminal equipment.

(d) Labeling developed for terminal equipment by the Administrative Council on Terminal Attachments shall contain sufficient information for providers of wireline telecommunications, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Customs Service to carry out their functions, and for consumers to easily identify the responsible party of their terminal equipment. The numbering and labeling scheme shall be nondiscriminatory, creating no competitive advantage for any entity or segment of the industry.

(e) FCC numbering and labeling requirements existing prior to the effective date of these rules shall remain unchanged until the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments publishes its numbering and labeling requirements.
