(a) Failure to comply with the Commission's rules or the terms of the NSA may warrant cancelling the Upper 700 MHz D Block license and awarding it to a new licensee. In the event the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is cancelled, the Commission shall issue an order cancelling the license and announcing the process for awarding rights to the spectrum to a new licensee. Pending the award to a new licensee, the Commission shall issue the Operating Company a special temporary authority to prevent interruption of services provided over the Shared Wireless Broadband Network. The Operating Company must continue to provide both commercial service and services to public safety during the transition. Upon grant of a new license, the Commission shall establish the terms and timing under which the special temporary authorization shall be cancelled and the new Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee assumes the construction and operation of the network.

(b) If the Commission cancels or terminates the Upper 700 MHz D Block license, a fair market valuation of the shared wireless broadband network assets shall be performed immediately, pursuant to the fair market valuation methodology set forth in the NSA. In the event that the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is awarded to a new entity, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's option to purchase the network and all network assets if and whenever the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is cancelled or terminated and its right of first refusal to purchase the network assets if and whenever such assets are otherwise to be sold shall be assigned to the new Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the new Network Assets Holder.
