(a) An EA or Regional licensee must construct a sufficient number of base stations (i.e., base stations for land mobile and/or paging operations) to provide coverage to at least one-third of the population of its EA or REAG within five years of the issuance of its initial license and at least two-thirds of the population of its EA or REAG within ten years of the issuance of its initial license. Licensees may, in the alternative, provide substantial service to their licensed areas at the appropriate five- and ten-year benchmarks.

(b) Licensees must notify the Commission in accordance with ยง 1.946 of this chapter of compliance with the Construction requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Failure by an EA or Regional licensee to meet the construction requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable, will result in automatic cancellation of its entire EA or Regional license. In such instances, EA or Regional licenses will not be converted to individual, site-by-site authorizations for already constructed stations.

(d) EA and Regional licensees will not be permitted to count the resale of the services of other providers in their EA or REAG, e.g., incumbent, Phase I licensees, to meet the construction requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, as applicable.

(e) EA and Regional licensees will not be required to construct and place in operation, or commence service on, all of their authorized channels at all of their base stations or fixed stations.
