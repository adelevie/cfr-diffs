Each class of station in the experimental services shall, unless specifically exempted by the terms of the station authorization, transmit its assigned call sign at the end of each complete transmission: Provided, however, that the transmission of the call sign at the end of each transmission is not required for projects requiring continuous, frequent, or extended use of the transmitting apparatus, if, during such periods and in connection with such use, the call sign is transmitted at least once every thirty minutes. The station identification shall be transmitted in clear voice or Morse code. All digital encoding and digital modulation shall be disabled during station identification.
