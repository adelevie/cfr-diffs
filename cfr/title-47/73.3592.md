(a) Where a grant of an application would preclude the grant of any application or applications mutually exclusive with it, the FCC may, if the public interest will be served thereby, make a conditional grant of one of the applications and designate all of the mutually exclusive applications for hearing. Such conditional grant will be made upon the express condition that such grant is subject to being withdrawn if, at the hearing, it is shown that public interest will be better served by a grant of one of the other applications. Such conditional grants will be issued only where it appears:

(1) That some or all of the applications were not filed in good faith but were filed for the purpose of delaying or hindering the grant of another application; or

(2) That public interest requires the prompt establishment of broadcast service in a particular community or area; or

(3) That a grant of one or more applications would be in the public interest, and that a delay in making a grant to any applicant until after the conclusion of a hearing on all applications might jeopardize the rights of the United States under the provisions of international agreement to the use of the frequency in question; or

(4) That a grant of one application would be in the public interest, and that it appears from an examination of the remaining applications that they cannot be granted because they are in violation of provisions of the Communications Act, other statutes, or the provisions of the FCC rules.

(b) When two or more applications for the same AM, FM or TV assignment have been designated for hearing, the FCC may, if the public interest will be served thereby, make a conditional grant to a group composed of any two or more of the competing applicants, such grant to terminate when the successful applicant commences operation under the terms of a regular authorization. No conditional grant will be made unless all of the competing applicants have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in the group seeking the conditional grant. In its application, the group shall include a special showing as to the need for the service pending operation by the successful applicant under the terms of a regular authorization; the effect, if any, of a grant on the position of any applicant which is not a member of the group; and any other factors which are deemed pertinent to the public interest judgment.
