(a) The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to unlicensed PCS devices, except where specific provisions are contained in subpart D.

(b) The requirements of subpart D apply only to the radio transmitter contained in the PCS device. Other aspects of the operation of a PCS device may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a PCS device that includes digital circuitry not directly associated with the radio transmitter also is subject to the requirements for unintentional radiators in subpart B.
