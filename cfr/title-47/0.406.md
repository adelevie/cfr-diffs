Persons having business with the Commission should familiarize themselves with those portions of its rules and regulations pertinent to such business. All of the rules have been published and are readily available. See §§ 0.411(b), 0.412, and 0.415. For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the rules, there is set forth in this section a brief description of their format and contents.

(a) Format. The rules are set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations as chapter I of title 47. Chapter I is divided into parts numbered from 0-99. Each part, in turn, is divided into numbered sections. To allow for the addition of new parts and sections in logical sequence, without extensive renumbering, parts and sections are not always numbered consecutively. Thus, for example, part 2 is followed by part 5, and § 1.8 is followed by § 1.10; in this case, parts 3 and 4 and § 1.9 have been reserved for future use. In numbering sections, the number before the period is the part number; and the number after the period locates the section within that part. Thus, for example, § 1.1 is the first section of part 1 and § 5.1 is the first section in part 5. Except in the case of accounting regulations (parts 31-35), the period should not be read as a decimal point; thus, § 1.511 is not located between §§ 1.51 and 1.52 but at a much later point in the rules. In citing the Code of Federal Regulations, the citation, 47 CFR 5.1, for example, is to § 5.1 (in part 5) of chapter I of title 47 of the Code, and permits the exact location of that rule. No citation to other rule units (e.g., subpart or chapter) is needed.
