(a) Transmitting antennas may be omnidirectional or directional, consistent with coverage and interference requirements.

(b) The use of horizontal or vertical plane wave polarization, or right hand or left hand rotating elliptical polarization must be used to minimize harmful interference between stations.

(c) Directive antennas must be used at all DEMS User Stations and may be elevated no higher than necessary to assure adequate service. Antenna structures requiring FAA notification under part 17 of this chapter must be registered with the Commission. The structure owner is responsible for registering, painting, and lighting the structure if applicable. Requests for such authorization must show the inclusive dates of the proposed operation.
