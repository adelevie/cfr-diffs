(3) For reduced or variable level carrier:

(i) In the 1600-4000 kHz band:

(A) For coast station transmitters 18±2 dB below peak envelope power;

(B) For ship station transmitters installed before January 2, 1982, 16±2 dB below peak envelope power; and

(C) For ship station transmitters installed after January 1, 1982, 18±2 dB below peak envelope power.

(ii) In the 4000-27500 kHz band:

(A) For coast station transmitters 18±2 dB below peak envelope power;

(B) For ship station transmitters installed before January 2, 1978, 16±2 dB below peak envelope power; and

(C) For ship station transmitters installed after January 1, 1978, 18±2 dB below peak envelope power.
