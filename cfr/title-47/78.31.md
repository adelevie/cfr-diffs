Where there is pending before the Commission any application, investigation, or proceeding which, after hearing, might lead to or make necessary the modification of, revocation of or the refusal to renew an existing cable television relay station license, the Commission will grant a temporary extension of such license: Provided, however, That no such temporary extension shall be construed as a finding by the Commission that the operation of any CARS station thereunder will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity beyond the express terms of such temporary extension of license: And provided, further, That such temporary extension of license will in nowise affect or limit the action of the Commission with respect to any pending application or proceeding.
