(a) Stations operating in the Experimental Radio Service may be authorized to use any government or non-government frequency designated in the Table of Frequency Allocations set forth in part 2 of this chapter, provided that the need for the frequency requested is fully justified by the applicant.

(b) Each frequency or band of frequencies available for assignment to stations in the Experimental Radio Service is available on a shared basis only, and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any one applicant, and such use may also be restricted to one or more specified geographical areas. Not more than one frequency in a band of frequencies will normally be assigned for the use of a single applicant unless a showing is made demonstrating that need for the assignment of additional frequencies is essential to the proposed program of experimentation.

(c) Frequency assignments will be made only on the condition that harmful interference will not be caused to any station operating in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocation of part 2 of this chapter.

(d) Use of Public Safety Frequencies. Applicants in the Experimental Radio Service must avoid use of public safety frequencies except when a compelling showing can be made that use of such frequencies is in the public interest. Public safety frequencies are identified in subpart B (Public Safety Radio Services) and subpart C (Special Emergency Radio Service) of part 90 of this Chapter. In addition, subpart S of part 90 of this chapter contains rules for the assignment of frequencies that may be used by Public Safety Radio Services in the 806-824 MHz and 851-869 MHz bands. If an experimental license to use public safety radio frequencies is granted, the authorization will be conditioned to require coordination between the experimental licensee and the appropriate frequency coordinator and/or all of the public safety licensees in its intended area of operation.

(e) The Commission may, at its discretion, condition any experimental license or STA on the requirement that before commencing operation, the new licensee coordinate its proposed facility with other licensees that may receive interference as a result of the new licensee's operations.

(f) Protection of FCC monitoring stations. (1) Applicants are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications, to the need to protect FCC monitoring stations from harmful interference. Geographical coordinates of such stations are listed in ยง 0.121(b) of this chapter. Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that will produce on any frequency a direct wave fundamental field strength of greater than 10 mV/m in the authorized bandwidth of service (-65.8 dBW/m2 power flux density assuming a free space characteristic impedance of 120ฯ ohms) at the referenced coordinates, may be examined to determine the extent of possible interference. Depending on the theoretical field strength value or other ambient radio field signal levels at the indicated coordinates, a clause protecting the monitoring station may be added to the station authorization.

(2) In the event that calculated value of expected field strength exceeds 10 mV/m (-65.8 dBW/m2) at the reference coordinates, or if there is any question whether field strength levels might exceed the threshold value, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss any protection necessary should be considered. Prospective applicants may communicate with the Technology Division, Compliance and Information Bureau, telephone (202) 418-1210, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.

(3) Advance consultation is suggested particularly for those applicants who have no reliable data that indicates whether the field strength or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by their proposed radio facilities (except mobile stations). In such instances, the following is a suggested guide for determining whether an applicant should coordinate:

(i) All stations within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 statute miles);

(ii) Stations within 4.8 kilometers (3 statute miles) with 50 watts or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;

(iii) Stations within 16 kilometers (10 statute miles) with 1 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station;

(iv) Stations within 80 kilometers (50 statute miles) with 25 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Monitoring Station.

(4) Advance coordination for stations operating above 1000 MHz is recommended only where the proposed station is in the vicinity of a monitoring station designated as a satellite monitoring facility in ยง 0.121(c) of this Chapter and also meets the criteria outlined in paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section.

(5) The Commission will not screen applications to determine whether advance consultation has taken place. However, applicants are advised that such consultation can avoid objections from the Commission.
