Class A TV stations must protect the DTV service that would be provided by the facilities specified in the DTV Table of Allotments in § 73.622 of this part, by authorized DTV stations and by applications that propose to expand DTV stations' allotted or authorized coverage contour in any direction, if such applications either were filed before December 31, 1999 or were filed between December 31, 1999 and May 1, 2000 by a DTV station licensee or permittee that had notified the Commission of its intent to “maximize” by December 31, 1999. Protection of these allotments, stations and applications must be based on not causing predicted interference within the service area described in § 73.622(e) of this part. The interference analysis is based on the methods described in §§ 73.623(c)(2) through (c)(4) of this part, except that a Class A TV station must not cause a loss of service to 0.5 percent or more of the population predicted to receive service from the DTV allotment, station or application. An application to change the facilities of an existing Class A TV station will not be accepted if it fails to protect these DTV allotments, stations and applications in accordance with this section.
