(a) The provisions of subparts A, B, and C of this part apply to unlicensed U-NII devices, except where specific provisions are contained in subpart E. Manufacturers should note that this includes the provisions of §§ 15.203 and 15.205.

(b) The requirements of subpart E apply only to the radio transmitter contained in the U-NII device. Other aspects of the operation of a U-NII device may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a U-NII device that includes digital circuitry not directly associated with the radio transmitter also is subject to the requirements for unintentional radiators in subpart B.
