(b) Was not cancelled in accordance with ยง 80.335;

(c) Could not be verified as a result of either the ship's failure to keep watch on appropriate frequencies in accordance with ยง 80.1123 or subpart G of this part, or its failure to respond to calls from the U.S. Coast Guard;

(d) Was repeated; or

(e) Was transmitted using a false identity.
