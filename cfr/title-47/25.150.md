Applications received by the Commission are given a file number and (domestic only) a unique station identifier for administrative convenience. Neither the assignment of a file number and/or other identifier nor the listing of the application on public notice as received for filing indicates that the application has been found acceptable for filing or precludes the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found to be defective or not in accordance with the Commission's rules.
