Each candidate for an amateur radio license which requires the applicant to pass one or more examination elements must present the Volunteer Examiners (VEs) with a properly completed FCC Form 605 prior to the examination. Upon completion of the examination, the VEs will grade the test papers. If the applicant is successful, the VEs will forward the candidate's application to a Volunteer-Examiner Coordinator (VEC). The VEs will then issue a certificate for sucessful completion of an amateur radio operator examination. The VEC will forward the application to the Commission's Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, facility.
