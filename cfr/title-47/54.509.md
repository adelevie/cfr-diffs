(a) Estimating future spending requests. When submitting their requests for specific amounts of funding for a funding year, schools, libraries, library consortia, and consortia including such entities shall also estimate their funding requests for the following funding year to enable the Administrator, to estimate funding demand for the following year.

(b) Reduction in percentage discounts. At all times other than within a filing period described in ยง 54.507(c), if the estimates schools and libraries make of their future funding needs lead the Administrator to predict that total funding request for a funding year will exceed the available funding, the Administrator shall calculate the percentage reduction to all schools and libraries, except those in the two most disadvantaged categories, necessary to permit all requests in the next funding year to be fully funded.

(c) Remaining funds. If funds remain under the cap at the end of the funding year in which discounts have been reduced below those set in the matrices, the Administrator shall consult with the Commission to establish the best way to distribute those funds.
