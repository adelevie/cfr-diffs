(a) A Class A TV station will be protected from interference within the following predicted signal contours:

(1) 62 dBu for stations on Channels 2 through 6;

(2) 68 dBu for stations on Channels 7 through 13; and

(3) 74 dBu for stations on Channels 14 through 51.

(b) The Class A TV station protected contour is calculated from the effective radiated power and antenna height above average terrain, using the F(50,50) charts of Figure 9, 10 or 10b of ยง 73.699 of this part.

(c) A digital Class A TV station will be protected from interference within the following predicted signal contours:

(1) 43 dBu for stations on Channels 2 through 6;

(2) 48 dBu for stations on Channels 7 through 13; and

(3) 51 dBu for stations on Channels 14 through 51.

(d) The digital Class A TV station protected contour is calculated from the effective radiated power and antenna height above average terrain, using the F(50,90) signal propagation method specified in ยง 73.625(b)(1) of this part.
