These provisions authorize and govern the use of radioteleprinter and radiofacsimile devices for base station use (other than on mobile-only or paging-only frequencies) in all radio pools and services except Radiolocation in this part.

(a) Information must be submitted with an application to establish that the minimum separation between a proposed radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile base station and the nearest co-channel base station of another licensee operating a voice system is 120 km (75 mi) for a single frequency mode of operation, or 56 km (35 mi) for two frequency mode of operation. Where this minimum mileage separation cannot be achieved, either agreement to the use of F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission must be received from all existing co-channel licensees using voice emission within the applicable mileage limits, or if agreement was not received, the licensee of the radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile system is responsible for eliminating any interference with preexisting voice operations. New licensees of voice operations will be expected to share equally any frequency occupied by established radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile operations.

(b) [Reserved]

(c) Transmitters certificated under this part for use of G3E or F3E emission may also be used for F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission for radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile, provided the keying signal is passed through the low pass audio frequency filter required for G3E or F3E emission. The transmitter must be so adjusted and operated that the instantaneous frequency deviation does not exceed the maximum value allowed for G3E or F3E.

(d) Frequencies will not be assigned exclusively for F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission for radioteleprinter or radiofacsimile (except where specifically provided for in the frequency limitations).

(e) The requirements in this part applicable to the use of G3E or F3E emission are also applicable to the use of F1B, F2B, F3C, G1B, G2B or G3C emission for radioteleprinter and radiofacsimile transmissions.

(f) The station identification required by § 90.425 must be given by voice or Morse code.

(g) For single sideband operations in accordance with § 90.266, transmitters certified under this part for use of J3E emission may also be used for A2B and F2B emissions for radioteleprinter transmissions. Transmitters certified under this part for use of J3E emission in accordance with §§ 90.35(c)(1)(A), 90.35(c)(1)(B), 90.35(c)(1)(C) and 90.257(a) may also be used for A1B, A2B, F1B, F2B, J2B, and A3C emissions to provide standby backup circuits for operational telecommunications circuits which have been disrupted, where so authorized in other sections of this part.
