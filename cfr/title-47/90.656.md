(a) The licensees of base stations that provide Specialized Mobile Radio service on a commercial basis of the use of individuals, Federal government agencies, or persons eligible for licensing under either subparts B or C of this part will be responsible for exercising effective operational control over all mobile and control stations that communicate with the base station. The base station licensee will be responsible for assuring that its system is operated in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations.

(b) Customers that operate mobile units on a particular Specialized Mobile Radio system will be licensed to that system. A customer that operates temporarily on more than one system will be deemed, when communicating with the other system, to be temporarily licensed to the other system and for that temporary period, the licensee of the other system will assume the same licensee responsibility for the customer's mobile station(s) as if the customer's stations were licensed to that other system.
