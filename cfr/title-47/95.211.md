(a) You may only use your R/C station to transmit one-way communications. (One-way communications are transmissions which are not intended to establish communications with another station.)

(b) You may only use your R/C station for the following purposes:

(1) The operator turns on and/or off a device at a remote location (Refer to Diagram 1); or

(2) A sensor at a remote location turns on and/off an indicating device for the operator. (Refer to Diagram 2). Only Channels 26.995 to 27.255 MHz (see R/C Rule 7, ยง 95.207(a)(1)) may be used for this purpose. (A remote location means a place distant from the operator.)

(c) Your R/C station may transmit any appropriate non-voice emission.
