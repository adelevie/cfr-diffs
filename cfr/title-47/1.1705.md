(1) There will be two ways for parties to electronically file applications with the Commission: batch and interactive.

(i) Batch filing. Batch filing involves data transmission in a single action. Batch filers will follow a set Commission format for entering data.

Thus, batch filers will not receive immediate correction from the system as they enter the information.

(ii) Interactive filing. Interactive filing involves data transmission with screen-by-screen prompting from the Commission's COALS system. Interactive filers will receive prompts from the system identifying data entries outside the acceptable ranges of data for the individual fields at the time the data entry is made.

(2) Attachments to applications must be uploaded along with the electronically filed application whenever possible.

(3) Any associated documents submitted with an application must be uploaded as attachments to the application whenever possible. The attachment should be uploaded via COALS in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) whenever possible.
