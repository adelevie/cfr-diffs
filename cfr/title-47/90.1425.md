(a) The Public Safety Broadband Licensee, the Operating Company, the Network Assets Holder, and the Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee may at any time bring a complaint to the Commission based on a claim that another party to the NSA has deviated from the terms of the NSA, or a petition for a declaratory ruling to resolve the proper interpretation of an NSA term or provision. The Commission also may at any time, on its own motion, determine to address any material breach or interpret any NSA term or provision.

(b) The Commission shall have primary responsibility and jurisdiction for adjudicating disputes that arise following execution of the NSA. The Commission may, however, require the parties to first seek a settlement to the dispute or authorize the parties to resolve the dispute through litigation or other means. Breach of license terms, the NSA, or the Commission's rules may result in cancellation of the Public Safety Broadband License, the Upper 700 MHz D Block license, or both.

(c) The Chiefs of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau are delegated joint responsibility for adjudicating disputes.
