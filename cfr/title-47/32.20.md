(a) The number “32” (appearing to the left of the first decimal point) indicates the part number.

(b) The numbers immediately following to the right of the decimal point indicate, respectively, the section or account. All Part 32 Account numbers contain 4 digits to-the-right-of the decimal point.
              

(c) Cross references to accounts are made by citing the account numbers to the right of the decimal point; e.g., Account 2232 rather than the corresponding complete part 32 reference number 32.2232.
