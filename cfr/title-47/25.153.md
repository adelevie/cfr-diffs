(a) Where an application has been denied or dismissed with prejudice, the Commission will not consider a like application involving service of the same kind to the same area by the same applicant, or by its successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the benefit of any of the original parties in interest, until after the lapse of 12 months from the effective date of the Commission's action. The Commission may, for good cause shown, waive the requirements of this section.

(b) Where an appeal has been taken from the action of the Commission denying a particular application, another application for the same class of station and for the same area, in whole or in part, filed by the same applicant or by his successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of the original parties in interest, will not be considered until the final disposition of the appeal.
