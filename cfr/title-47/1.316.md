An original and three copies of the interrogatories and the notice (and of all related pleadings) shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission. A copy of the interrogatories and the notice (and of all related pleadings) shall be served on the presiding officer. The notice shall contain the following information:

(1) The name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs.

(2) The time and place for taking the deposition of each person to be examined, and the name or descriptive title and address of the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken.

(3) The matters upon which each person will be examined. See ยง 1.319.

Within 7 days after the filing and service of the original interrogatories, any other party to the proceeding may, in the same manner, file and serve additional interrogatories to be asked of the same witness at the same time and place, with notice to the witness of any additional matters upon which he will be examined.

(c) Cross interrogatories. Within 14 days after the filing and service of the original interrogatories, any party to the proceeding may, in the same manner, file and serve cross interrogatories, which shall be limited to matters raised in the original or in the additional interrogatories.

(d) Responsive pleadings. (1) Within 21 days after service of the original interrogatories, any party to the proceeding may move to limit or suppress any original, additional or cross interrogatory, and the person to be examined may file a motion opposing the taking of depositions.
