The dissipation rating of all the semiconductors or electron tubes which supply RF power to the antenna terminals of each CB transmitter must not exceed 10 W. For semiconductors, the dissipation rating is the greater of the collector or device dissipation value established by the manufacturer of the semiconductor. These values may be temperature de-rated by no more than 50 Â°C. For an electron tube, the dissipation rating is the Intermittent Commercial and Amateur Service plate dissipation value established by the manufacturer of the electron tube.
