(a) Failure to comply with the Commission's rules or the terms of the NSA may warrant cancelling the Public Safety Broadband License. The potential remedies also include, but are not limited to, assigning the license to another entity, directing the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to transfer the assignable right to purchase the assets at fair market value, ordering specific performance, or ordering removal and replacement of individual officers, directors or member organizations of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee.

(b) If the Commission cancels or terminates the Upper 700 MHz D Block license, a fair market valuation of the shared wireless broadband network assets shall be performed immediately, pursuant to the fair market valuation methodology set forth in the NSA. In the event that the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is awarded to a new entity, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's option to purchase the network and all network assets if and whenever the Upper 700 MHz D Block license is cancelled or terminated and its right of first refusal to purchase the network assets if and whenever such assets are otherwise to be sold shall be assigned to the new Upper 700 MHz D Block licensee and the new Network Assets Holder.
