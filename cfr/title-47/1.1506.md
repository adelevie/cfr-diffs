(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75.00, or for adversary adjudications commenced on or after March 29, 1996, $125.00, per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert witnesses.

(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;

(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;

(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and

(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the service provided.

(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
                

(e) Fees may be awarded only for work performed after designation of a proceeding or after issuance of a show cause order.
