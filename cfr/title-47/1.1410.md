If the Commission determines that the rate, term, or condition complained of is not just and reasonable, it may prescribe a just and reasonable rate, term, or condition and may:

(a) Terminate the unjust and unreasonable rate, term, or condition;

(b) Substitute in the pole attachment agreement the just and reasonable rate, term, or condition established by the Commission; and

(c) Order a refund, or payment, if appropriate. The refund or payment will normally be the difference between the amount paid under the unjust and/or unreasonable rate, term, or condition and the amount that would have been paid under the rate, term, or condition established by the Commission from the date that the complaint, as acceptable, was filed, plus interest.
