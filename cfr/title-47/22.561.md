The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to transmitters that provide (or support other transmitters that provide) one-way or two-way public land mobile service, either individually or collectively under a paging geographic area authorization. The paging geographic areas used for these channels are the EAs (see ยง 22.503(b)(3)). These channels may be assigned for use by mobile or base transmitters as indicated, and or by fixed transmitters (including control, repeater or other fixed transmitters). The mobile channels may also be assigned for use by base or fixed transmitters under certain circumstances (see ยง 22.567(h)). Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.
