(b) The following disclosure requirements apply to ex parte presentations in permit but disclose proceedings:

(1) Written presentations. A person who makes a written ex parte presentation subject to this section shall, no later than the next business day after the presentation, submit two copies of the presentation to the Commission's secretary under separate cover for inclusion in the public record. The presentation (and cover letter) shall clearly identify the proceeding to which it relates, including the docket number, if any, shall indicate that two copies have been submitted to the Secretary, and must be labeled as an ex parte presentation. If the presentation relates to more than one proceeding, two copies shall be filed for each proceeding. Alternatively, in rulemaking proceedings governed by § 1.49(f), the person making the presentation may file one copy of the presentation electronically; no additional paper copies need to be filed.

(2) Oral presentations. A person who makes an oral ex parte presentation subject to this section that presents data or arguments not already reflected in that person's written comments, memoranda or other filings in that proceeding shall, no later than the next business day after the presentation, submit to the Commission's Secretary, an original and one copy of a memorandum which summarizes the new data or arguments. Except in proceedings subject to § 1.49(f) in which pleadings are filed electronically, a copy of the memorandum must also be submitted to the Commissioners or Commission employees involved in the oral presentation. In proceedings governed by § 1.49(f), the person making the presentation may, alternatively, electronically file one copy of the memorandum, which will be available to Commissioners and Commission employees involved in the presentation through the Commission's electronic comment filing system. Memoranda must contain a summary of the substance of the ex parte presentation and not merely a listing of the subjects discussed. More than a one or two sentence description of the views and arguments presented is generally required. The memorandum (and cover letter) shall clearly identify the proceeding to which it relates, including the docket number, if any, shall indicate that an original and one copy have been submitted to the Secretary or that one copy has been filed electronically, and must be labeled as an ex parte presentation. If the presentation relates to more than one proceeding, two copies of the memorandum (or an original and one copy) shall be filed for each proceeding.
                

(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, in permit-but-disclose proceedings presentations made by members of Congress or their staffs or by an agency or branch of the Federal Government or its staff shall be treated as ex parte presentations only if the presentations are of substantial significance and clearly intended to affect the ultimate decision. The Commission staff shall prepare a written summary of any such oral presentations and place them in the record in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section and place any such written presentations in the record in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(4) Notice of ex parte presentations. The Commission's Secretary or, in the case of non-docketed proceedings, the relevant Bureau or Office shall place in the public file or record of the proceeding written ex parte presentations and memoranda reflecting oral ex parte presentations. The Secretary shall issue a public notice listing any written ex parte presentations or written summaries of oral ex parte presentations received by his or her office relating to any permit-but-disclose proceeding. Such public notices should generally be released at least twice per week.
