(2) Gains or losses related to the disposition of land and other nondepreciable items recorded in Account 7100 (Other operating income and expense) shall be included in net income for ratemaking purposes, but adjusted to reflect the relative amount of time such property was used in regulated operations and included in the rate base; and

(3) Proceeds related to the disposition of property depreciated on a group basis and used jointly in regulated and nonregulated activities, including sale-leaseback arrangements for property depreciated on a group basis, shall be credited to the related reserves and attributed to regulated and nonregulated in proportion to the accumulated regulated and nonregulated depreciation for that group.
