(a) Permittees and licensees of TV broadcast stations are not protected from any interference which may be caused by the grant of a new station or of authority to modify the facilities of an existing station in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. The nature and extent of the protection from interference accorded to TV broadcast stations is limited solely to the protection which results from the minimum allotment and station separation requirements and the rules and regulations with respect to maximum powers and antenna heights set forth in this subpart.

(b) When the Commission determines that grant of an application would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity and the instrument of authorization specifies an antenna location in a designated antenna farm area which results in distance separation less than those specified in this subpart, TV broadcast station permittees and licensees shall be afforded protection from interference equivalent to the protection afforded under the minimum distance separations specified in this subpart.
