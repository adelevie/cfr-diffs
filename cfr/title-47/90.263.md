Frequencies below 25 MHz when shown in the radio pool frequency listings under this part will be assigned to base or mobile stations only upon a satisfactory showing that, from a safety of life standpoint, frequencies above 25 MHz will not meet the operational requirements of the applicant. These frequencies are available for assignment in many areas; however, in individual cases such assignment may be impracticable due to conflicting frequency use authorized to stations in other services by this and other countries. In such cases, a substitute frequency, if found available, may be assigned from the following bands: 1705-1750 kHz, 2107-2170 kHz, 2194-2495 kHz, 2506-2850 kHz, 3155-3400 kHz, or 4438-4650 kHz. Since such assignments are in certain instances subject to additional technical and operation limitations, it is necessary that each application also include precise information concerning transmitter output power, type and directional characteristics, if any, of the antenna, and the minimum necessary hours of operation. (This section is not applicable to the Radiolocation Service, subpart F of this part.)
