When an application is granted by the FCC necessitating the issuance of a modified license less than 60 days prior to the expiration date of the license sought to be modified, and an application for renewal of the license is granted subsequent or prior thereto (but within 30 days of expiration of the present license), the modified license as well as the renewal license shall be issued to conform to the combined action of the FCC.
