If a BOC transfers to an affiliated entity ownership of any network elements that must be provided on an unbundled basis pursuant to section 251(c)(3) of the Act, such entity will be deemed to be an “assign” of the BOC under section 3(4) of the Act with respect to such transferred network elements. A BOC affiliate shall not be deemed a “successor or assign” of a BOC solely because it obtains network elements from the BOC pursuant to section 251(c)(3) of the Act.
