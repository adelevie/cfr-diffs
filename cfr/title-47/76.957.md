The Commission will consider the complaint and the cable operator's response and then determine by written decision whether the rate for the cable programming service or associated equipment is unreasonable or not. In making its determination, the Commission will only review the amount of the rate increase subject to the complaint. If the Commission determines that the rate change in question is unreasonable, it will grant the complaint and may order appropriate relief, including, but not limited to, prospective rate reductions and refunds. If it determines that the rate in question is reasonable, the Commission will deny the complaint.
