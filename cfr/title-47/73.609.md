(a) For the purpose of allotment and assignment, the United States is divided into three zones as follows:

(1) Zone I consists of that portion of the United States located within the confines of the following lines drawn on the U.S. Albers Equal Area Projection Map (based on standard parallels 291/2° and 451/2°; North American datum): Beginning at the most easterly point on the State boundary line between North Carolina and Virginia; thence in a straight line to a point on the Virginia-West Virginia boundary line located at north latitude 37°49′ and west longitude 80°12′30″; thence westerly along the southern boundary lines of the States of West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to a point at the junction of the Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri State boundary lines; thence northerly along the western boundary line of the State of Illinois to a point at the junction of the Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin State boundary lines; thence easterly along the northern State boundary line of Illinois to the 90th meridian; thence north along this meridian to the 43.5° parallel; thence east along this parallel to the United States-Canada border; thence southerly and following that border until it again intersects the 43.5° parallel; thence east along this parallel to the 71st meridian; thence in a straight line to the intersection of the 69th meridian and the 45th parallel; thence east along the 45th parallel to the Atlantic Ocean. When any of the above lines pass through a city, the city shall be considered to be located in Zone I. (See Figure 1 of § 73.699.)

(2) Zone II consists of that portion of the United States which is not located in either Zone I or Zone III, and Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaiian Islands and the Virgin Islands.

(3) Zone III consists of that portion of the United States located south of a line, drawn on the United States Albers Equal Area Projection Map (based on standard parallels 29.50 and 45.50 North American datum), beginning at a point on the east coast of Georgia and the 31st parallel and ending at the United States-Mexican border, consisting of arcs drawn with a 241.4 kilometer (150 mile) radius to the north from the following specified points:

When any of the above arcs pass through a city, the city shall be considered to be located in Zone II. (See Figure 2 of § 73.699.)
