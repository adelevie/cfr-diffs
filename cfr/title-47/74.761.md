The licensee of a low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station shall maintain the transmitter output frequencies as set forth below. The frequency tolerance of stations using direct frequency conversion of a received signal and not engaging in offset carrier operation as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section will be referenced to the authorized plus or minus 10 kHz offset, if any, of the primary station.

(a) The visual carrier shall be maintained to within 0.02 percent of the assigned visual carrier frequency for transmitters rated at not more than 100 watts peak visual power.

(b) The visual carrier shall be maintained to within 0.002 percent of the assigned visual carrier frequency for transmitters rated at more than 100 watts peak visual power.

(c) The aural carrier of stations employing modulating equipment shall be maintained at 4.5 MHz ±1 kHz above the visual carrier frequency.

(d) The visual carrier shall be maintained to within 1 kHz of the assigned channel carrier frequency if the low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station is authorized with a specified offset designation in order to provide protection under the provisions of § 74.705 or § 74.707.
