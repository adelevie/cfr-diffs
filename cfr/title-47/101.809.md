(a) Stations in this service operating on frequencies in the 27.23-27.28 MHz band will be authorized to employ only amplitude modulated or frequency modulated emission for radiotelephony. The authorization to use such emissions will be construed to include authority to employ unmodulated emission only for temporary or short periods necessary for equipment testing incident to the construction and maintenance of the station.

(b) Stations in the service operating on frequencies above 940 MHz may be authorized to use amplitude modulated, frequency modulated or pulse type of emission for radiotelephony and television. In addition, the use of unmodulated emission may be authorized in appropriate cases.

(c) The maximum bandwidths which will normally be authorized for single channel operation on frequencies below 500 MHz in this service must not exceed the limits set forth below:

(d) Maximum bandwidths in the following frequency bands must not exceed the limits set forth below:

(e) The bandwidths authorized on frequencies above 500 MHz must be appropriate to the type of operation in any particular case. An application requesting such authorization must fully describe the modulation, emission, and bandwidth desired and must specify the bandwidth to be occupied.
