(a) The carrier frequency of each transmitter authorized in these services must be maintained within the following percentage of the reference frequency except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section or in the applicable subpart of this part (unless otherwise specified in the instrument of station authorization the reference frequency will be deemed to be the assigned frequency):

(b) Heterodyne microwave radio systems may be authorized at a somewhat less restrictive frequency tolerance (up to .01 percent) to compensate for frequency shift caused by numerous repeaters between base band signal insertion. Where such relaxation is sought, applicant must provide all calculations and indicate the desired tolerance over each path. In such instances the radio transmitters and receivers used must individually be capable of complying with the tolerance specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Heterodyne operation is restricted to channel bandwidth of 10 MHz or greater.

(c) As an additional requirement in any band where the Commission makes assignments according to a specified channel plan, provisions must be made to prevent the emission included within the occupied bandwidth from radiating outside the assigned channel at a level greater than that specified in ยง 101.111.
