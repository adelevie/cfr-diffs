(b) Incumbent operators in the 928.0-928.85 MHz/952.0-952.85 MHz/956.25-956.45 MHz bands are grandfathered as of January 19, 2000, and may continue to operate and expand their systems pursuant to the interference protection and co-channel spacing criteria contained in ยง 101.105.

(1) MAS operators are prohibited from acquiring additional frequencies in the 928.0-928.85 MHz/952.0-952.85 MHz/956.25-956.45 MHz bands and the 932.25625-932.49375 MHz/941.25625-941.49375 MHz bands for the purpose of expanding private carrier service and from changing the use of their frequencies in any manner that is inconsistent with this part.
