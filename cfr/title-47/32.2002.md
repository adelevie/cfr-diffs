(a) This account shall include the original cost of property owned and held for no longer than two years under a definite plan for use in telecommunications service. If at the end of two years the property is not in service, the original cost of the property may remain in this account so long as the carrier excludes the original cost and associated depreciation from its ratebase and ratemaking considerations and report those amounts in reports filed with the Commission pursuant to 43.21(e)(1) and 43.21(e)(2) of this chapter.

(b) Subsidiary records shall be maintained to show the character of the amounts carried in this account.
