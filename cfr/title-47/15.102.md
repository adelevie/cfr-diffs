(a) Authorized CPU boards and power supplies that are sold as separate components shall be supplied with complete installation instructions. These instructions shall specify all of the installation procedures that must be followed to ensure compliance with the standards, including, if necessary, the type of enclosure, e.g., a metal enclosure, proper grounding techniques, the use of shielded cables, the addition of any needed components, and any necessary modifications to additional components.

(1) Any additional parts needed to ensure compliance with the standards, except for the enclosure, are considered to be special accessories and, in accordance with § 15.27, must be marketed with the CPU board or power supply.

(2) Any modifications that must be made to a personal computer, peripheral device, CPU board or power supply during installation of a CPU board or power supply must be simple enough that they can be performed by the average consumer. Parts requiring soldering, disassembly of circuitry or other similar modifications are not permitted.

(b) Assemblers of personal computer systems employing modular CPU boards and/or power supplies are not required to test the resulting system provided the following conditions are met:

(1) Each device used in the system has been authorized as required under this part (according to § 15.101(e), some subassemblies used in a personal computer system may not require an authorization);

(2) The original label and identification on each piece of equipment remain unchanged;

(3) Each responsible party's instructions to ensure compliance (including, if necessary, the use of shielded cables or other accessories or modifications) are followed when the system is assembled;

(4) If the system is marketed, the resulting equipment combination is authorized under a Declaration of Conformity pursuant to § 15.101(c)(4) and a compliance information statement, as described in § 2.1077(b), is supplied with the system. Marketed systems shall also comply with the labelling requirements in § 15.19 and must be supplied with the information required under §§ 15.21, 15.27 and 15.105; and

(5) The assembler of a personal computer system may be required to test the system and/or make necessary modifications if a system is found to cause harmful interference or to be noncompliant with the appropriate standards in the configuration in which it is marketed (see §§ 2.909, 15.1, 15.27(d) and 15.101(e)).
