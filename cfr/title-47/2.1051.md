The radio frequency voltage or powers generated within the equipment and appearing on a spurious frequency shall be checked at the equipment output terminals when properly loaded with a suitable artificial antenna. Curves or equivalent data shall show the magnitude of each harmonic and other spurious emission that can be detected when the equipment is operated under the conditions specified in ยง 2.1049 as appropriate. The magnitude of spurious emissions which are attenuated more than 20 dB below the permissible value need not be specified.
