BRS and EBS licensees in the 2500-2690 MHz band on the pre-transition A-I Channels will be transitioned from the frequencies assigned to them under § 27.5(i)(1) to the frequencies assigned to them under § 27.5(i)(2). The transition, which will be undertaken by one or more proponent(s), will occur in the following five phases: initiating the transition process (see § 27.1231), planning the transition (see § 27.1232), reimbursing transition costs (see §§ 27.1233 and 27.1237-1239), terminating existing operations in transitioned markets that do not comport with § 27.5(i)(2) (see § 27.1234), and filing the post-transition notification (see § 27.1235). Licensees may also self-transition (see § 27.1236).
