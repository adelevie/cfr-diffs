(a) “Safety net additive support.” Beginning January 1, 2012, only those local exchange carriers that qualified in 2010 or earlier, based on 2009 or prior year costs, shall be eligible to receive safety net additive pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Local exchange carriers shall not receive safety net additive for growth of Telecommunications Plant in Service in 2011, as compared to 2010. A local exchange carrier qualifying for safety net additive shall no longer receive safety net additive after January 1, 2012 unless the carrier's realized total growth in Telecommunications Plant in Service was more than 14 percent during the qualifying period, defined as 2010 or earlier, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. A local exchange carrier qualifying for safety net additive that fails to meet the requirements set forth in the preceding sentence will receive 50 percent of the safety net additive that it otherwise would have received pursuant to this rule in 2012 and will cease to receive safety net additive in 2013 and thereafter.

(b) Calculation of safety net additive support for companies that qualified prior to 2011: Safety net additive support is equal to the amount of capped support calculated pursuant to this subpart F in the qualifying year minus the amount of support in the year prior to qualifying for support subtracted from the difference between the uncapped expense adjustment for the study area in the qualifying year minus the uncapped expense adjustment in the year prior to qualifying for support as shown in the following equation: Safety net additive support = (Uncapped support in the qualifying year—Uncapped support in the base year)—(Capped support in the qualifying year—Amount of support received in the base year).

(c) Operation of safety net additive support for companies that qualified prior to 2011: (1) In any year in which the total carrier loop cost expense adjustment is limited by the provisions of § 36.603 a rate-of-return incumbent local exchange carrier, as set forth in § 36.601(a) of this subpart, shall receive safety net additive support as calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, if in any study area, the rural incumbent local exchange carrier realizes growth in end of period Telecommunications Plant in Service (TPIS), as prescribed in § 32.2001 of this chapter, on a per loop basis, of at least 14 percent more than the study area's TPIS per loop investment at the end of the prior period.

(2) If paragraph (c)(1) of this section is met, the rural incumbent local exchange carrier must notify the Administrator; failure to properly notify the Administrator of eligibility shall result in disqualification of that study area for safety net additive, requiring the rural incumbent local exchange carrier to again meet the eligibility requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for that study area in a subsequent period.

(3) Upon completion of verification by the Administrator that the study area meets the stated criterion in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) of this section, the Administrator shall:

(i) Pay to any qualifying rural telephone company, safety net additive support for the qualifying study area in accordance with the calculation set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(ii) Continue to pay safety net additive support in any of the four succeeding years in which the total carrier loop expense adjustment is limited by the provisions of § 36.603. Safety net additive support in the succeeding four years shall be the lesser of:

(A) The sum of capped support and the safety net additive support received in the qualifying year; or

(B) The rural telephone company's uncapped support.
