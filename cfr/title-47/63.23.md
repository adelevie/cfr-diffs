The following conditions apply to carriers authorized to resell the international services of other authorized carriers:

(a) A carrier authorized under § 63.18(e)(2) may provide resold international services to international points for which the applicant qualifies for non-dominant regulation as set forth in § 63.10, except that the carrier may not provide either of the following services unless it has received specific authority to do so under § 63.18(e)(3):

(1) Resold switched services to a non-WTO Member country where the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier; and

(2) Switched or private line services over resold private lines to a destination market where the applicant is, or is affiliated with, a foreign carrier and the Commission has not determined that the foreign carrier lacks market power in the destination market (see § 63.10(a)).

(b) The carrier may not resell the international services of an affiliated carrier regulated as dominant on the route to be served unless it has received specific authority to do so under § 63.18(e)(3).

(c) Subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (b) of this section and in § 63.17(b), the carrier may provide service by reselling the international services of any other authorized U.S. common carrier or foreign carrier, or by entering into a roaming or other arrangement with a foreign carrier, for the provision of international basic switched, private line, data, television and business services to all international points.
              

(d) The carrier may provide switched basic services over its authorized resold private lines in either of the following two circumstances:

(1) The country at the foreign end of the private line appears on the Commission's list of international routes exempted from the international settlements policy set forth in § 64.1002 of this chapter; or

(2) The carrier is exchanging switched traffic with a foreign carrier that lacks market power in the country at the foreign end of the private line. A foreign carrier lacks market power for purposes of this section if it does not appear on the Commission's list of foreign carriers that do not qualify for the presumption that they lack market power in particular foreign points.
              

(e) Any party certified to provide international resold private lines to a particular geographic market shall report its circuit additions on an annual basis. Circuit additions should indicate the specific services provided (e.g., IMTS or private line) and the country served. This report shall be filed on a consolidated basis not later than March 31 for the preceding calendar year.

(f) The authority granted under this part is subject to all Commission rules and regulations and any conditions or limitations stated in the Commission's public notice or order that serves as the carrier's Section 214 certificate. See §§ 63.12, 63.21 of this part.
