(a) The use of modulating frequencies higher than 3000 hertz for single channel radiotelephony or tone signaling on frequencies below 500 MHz is not authorized.

(b) When amplitude modulation is used, the modulation percentage must be sufficient to provide efficient communication and must normally be maintained above 70 percent on positive peaks, but may not exceed 100 percent on negative peaks.

(c) When phase or frequency modulation is used for single channel radiotelephony on frequencies below 500 MHz, the deviation arising from modulation may not exceed plus or minus 15 kHz from the unmodulated carrier.
                                    

(d) Each unmultiplexed radiotelephone transmitter having more than 3 watts plate power input to the final radio frequency stage and initially installed at the station in this service after September 4, 1956, must be provided with a device that will automatically prevent modulation in excess of that specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section which may be caused by greater than normal audio level.
