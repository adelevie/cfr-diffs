Whenever painting or lighting is required, the Commission will generally assign specifications in accordance with the FAA Advisory Circulars referenced in ยง 17.23. If an antenna installation is of such a nature that its painting and lighting in accordance with these specifications are confusing, or endanger rather than assist airmen, or are otherwise inadequate, the Commission will specify the type of painting and lighting or other marking to be used in the individual situation.
