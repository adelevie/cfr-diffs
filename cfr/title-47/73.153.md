In the determination of interference, groundwave field strength measurements will take precedence over theoretical values, provided such measurements are properly taken and presented. When measurements of groundwave signal strength are presented, they shall be sufficiently complete in accordance with ยง 73.186 to determine the field strength at 1 mile in the pertinent directions for that station. The antenna resistance measurements required by ยง 73.186 need not be taken or submitted.
