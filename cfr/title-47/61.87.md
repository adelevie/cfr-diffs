(a) An issuing carrier may cancel an entire tariff. Cancellation of a tariff automatically cancels every page and supplement to that tariff except for the canceling Title Page or first page.

(1) If the existing service(s) will be provided under another carrier's tariff, then

(i) The issuing carrier whose tariff is being canceled must revise the Title Page or the first page of its tariff indicating that the tariff is no longer effective, or

(ii) The issuing carrier under whose tariff the service(s) will be provided must revise the Title Page or first page of the tariff to be canceled, using the name and numbering shown in the heading of the tariff to be canceled, indicating that the tariff is no longer effective. This carrier must also file with the Commission the new tariff provisions reflecting the service(s) being canceled. Both filings must be effective on the same date and may be filed under the same transmittal.

(2) If a carrier canceling its tariff intends to cease to provide existing service, then it must revise the Title Page or first page of its tariff indicating that the tariff is no longer effective.

(3) A carrier canceling its tariff, as described in this section, must comply with §§ 61.54(b)(1) and 61.54(b)(5), as applicable.

(b) When a carrier cancels a tariff as described in this section, the canceling Title Page or the first page of the canceled tariff must show where all rates and regulations will be found except for paragraph (c) of this section. The Title Page or first page of the new tariff must indicate the name of the carrier and tariff number where the canceled material had been found.

(c) When a carrier ceases to provide service(s) without a successor, it must cancel its tariff pursuant to the notice requirements of § 61.58, as applicable, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.
