(a) A cable operator has the burden of proving that its existing or proposed rates for basic service and associated equipment comply with 47 U.S.C. 543, and §§ 76.922 and 76.923.

(b) For an existing or a proposed rate for basic tier service or associated equipment that is within the permitted tier charge and actual cost of equipment as set forth in §§ 76.922 and 76.923, the cable operator must submit the appropriate FCC form.

(c) For an existing or a proposed rate for basic tier service that exceeds the permitted tier charge as set forth in §§ 76.922 and 76.923, the cable operator must submit a cost-of-service showing to justify the proposed rate.

(d) A franchising authority or the Commission may find a cable operator that does not attempt to demonstrate the reasonableness of its rates in default and, using the best information available, enter an order finding the cable operator's rates unreasonable and mandating appropriate relief, as specified in §§ 76.940, 76.941, and 76.942.

(e) A franchising authority or the Commission may order a cable operator that has filed a facially incomplete form to file supplemental information, and the franchising authority's deadline to rule on the reasonableness of the proposed rates will be tolled pending the receipt of such information. A franchising authority may set reasonable deadlines for the filing of such information, and may find the cable operator in default and mandate appropriate relief, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, for the cable operator's failure to comply with the deadline or otherwise provide complete information in good faith.
