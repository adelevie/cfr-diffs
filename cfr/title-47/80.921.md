(a) When directed by a representative of the Commission the vessel must prove by demonstration as prescribed in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section, that the requirements of ยง 80.919 are met.

(b) Proof of the ability of a storage battery used as a main or reserve power supply to operate over the 3-hour period established by a discharge test over the prescribed period of time, when supplying power at the voltage required for an electrical loss as prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section.

(c) When the required power supply consists of an engine-driven generator, proof of the adequacy of the engine fuel supply to operate the unit over the 3-hour period of time may be established by using as a basis the fuel consumption during a 1 hour period when supplying power, at the voltage required for operating an electrical load as prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) In determining the required electrical load the following formula must be used:

(1) One-half of the current of the required transmitter at its rated output power; plus

(2) Current of the required receiver; plus

(3) Current of electric light, if required by ยง 80.925; plus

(4) The sum of the current of all other loads the reserve power supply may provide in time of emergency.

(e) At the conclusion of the test specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no part of the main or reserve power supply must have an excessive temperature rise, nor must the specific gravity or voltage of any storage battery be below the 90 percent discharge point.
