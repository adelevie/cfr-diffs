(a) In connection with any price cap tariff filing proposing changes in the rates of services in service categories, subcategories, or density zones, the carrier must calculate an SBI value for each affected service category, subcategory, or density zone pursuant to the following methodology:
                                    

(b) New services that are added to existing service categories or subcategories must be included in the appropriate SBI calculations under paragraph (a) of this section beginning at the first annual price cap tariff filing following completion of the base period in which they are introduced. This index adjustment requires that the demand for the new service during the base period must be included in determining the weights used in calculating the SBI.

(c) In the event that the introduction of a new service requires the creation of a new service category or subcategory, a new SBI must be established for that service category or subcategory beginning at the first annual price cap tariff filing following completion of the base period in which the new service is introduced. The new SBI should be initialized at a value of 100, corresponding to the service category or subcategory rates in effect the last day of the base period, and thereafter should be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) Any price cap tariff filing proposing rate restructuring shall require an adjustment to the affected SBI pursuant to the general methodology described in paragraph (a) of this section. This adjustment requires the conversion of existing rates in the rate element group into rates of equivalent value under the proposed structure, and then the comparison of the existing rates that have been converted to reflect restructuring to the proposed restructured rates. This calculation may require use of carrier data and estimation techniques to assign customers of the preexisting service to those services (including the new restructured service) that will remain or become available after restructuring.

(e) Pricing bands shall be established each tariff year for each service category and subcategory within a basket. Each band shall limit the pricing flexibility of the service category, subcategory, as reflected in the SBI, to an annual increase of a specified percent listed in this paragraph, relative to the percentage change in the PCI for that basket, measured from the levels in effect on the last day of the preceding tariff year. For local exchanage carriers subject to price cap regulation as that term is defined in § 61.3(ee), there shall be no lower pricing band for any service category or subcategory.

(1) Five percent:

(i) Local Switching (traffic sensitive basket)

(ii) Information (traffic sensitive basket)

(iii) Database Access Services (traffic sensitive basket)

(iv) 800 Database Vertical Services subservice (traffic sensitive basket)

(v) Billing Name and Address (traffic sensitive basket)

(vi) Local Switching Trunk Ports (traffic sensitive basket)

(vii) Signalling Transfer Point Port Termination (traffic sensitive basket)

(viii) Voice Grade (trunking and special access baskets)

(ix) Audio/Video (special access basket)

(x) Total High Capacity (trunking and special access baskets)

(xi) DS1 Subservice (trunking and special access baskets)

(xii) DS3 Subservice (trunking and special access baskets)

(xiii) Wideband (special access basket)

(2) Two percent:

(i) Tandem-Switched Transport (trunking basket)

(ii) Signalling for Tandem Switching (trunking basket)

(f) A price cap local exchange carrier may establish density zones pursuant to the requirements set forth in § 69.123 of this chapter, for any service in the trunking and special access baskets, other than the interconnection charge set forth in § 69.124 of this chapter. The pricing flexibility of each zone shall be limited to an annual increase of 15 percent, relative to the percentage change in the PCI for that basket, measured from the levels in effect on the last day of the preceding tariff year. There shall be no lower pricing band for any density zone.

(g)-(i)(l) [Reserved]

(2) Effective January 1, 1998, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, if a price cap local exchange carrier is recovering interconnection charge revenues through per-minute rates pursuant to § 69.155 of this chapter, any reductions to the PCI for the basket designated in § 61.42(d)(3) resulting from the application of the provisions of § 61.45(b)(1)(i) and from the application of the provisions of §§ 61.45(i)(1) and 61.45(i)(2) shall be directed to the SBI of the service category designated in § 61.42(d)(i).

(3) [Reserved]

(4) Effective January 1, 1998, the SBI reduction required by paragraph (i)(2) of this section shall be determined by dividing the sum of the dollar amount of any PCI reduction required by §§ 61.45(i)(1) and 61.45(i)(2), by the dollar amount associated with the SBI for the service category designated in § 61.42(e)(2)(vi), and multiplying the SBI for the service category designated in § 61.42(e)(2)(vi) by one minus the resulting ratio.

(5) Effective July 1, 2000, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and subject to the limitations of § 61.45(i), if a price cap local exchange carrier is recovering an ATS charge greater than its Target Rate as set forth in § 61.3(qq), any reductions to the PCI for the traffic sensitive or trunking baskets designated in §§ 61.42(d)(2) and 61.42(d)(3) resulting from the application of the provisions of § 61.45(b), and the formula in § 61.45(b) and from the application of the provisions of §§ 61.45(i)(1), and 61.45(i)(2) shall be directed to the SBIs of the service categories designated in §§ 61.42(e)(1) and 61.42(e)(2).

(j) [Reserved]

(k) In no case shall a price cap local exchange carrier include data associated with services offered pursuant to contract tariff in the calculations required by this section.
