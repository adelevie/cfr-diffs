(a) For mutually exclusive applications subject to selection by competitive bidding (non-reserved channels) or fair distribution/point system (reserved channels), petitions to deny may be filed only against the winning bidders or tentative selectee(s), and such petitions will be governed by §§ 73.5006 and 73.7004, respectively. For all other applications the following rules will govern. Except in the case of applications for new low power TV, TV translator or TV booster stations, for major changes in the existing facilities of such stations, or for applications for a change in output channel tendered by displaced low power TV and TV translator stations pursuant to § 73.3572(a)(1), any party in interest may file with the Commission a Petition to Deny any application (whether as originally filed or if amended so as to require a new file number pursuant to § 73.3571(j), § 73.3572(b), § 73.3573(b), § 73.3574(b) or § 73.3578) for which local notice pursuant to § 73.3580 is required, provided such petitions are filed prior to the day such applications are granted or designated for hearing; but where the FCC issues a public notice pursuant to the provisions of § 73.3571(c), § 73.3572(c) or § 73.3573(d), establishing a “cut-off” date, such petitions must be filed by the date specified. In the case of applications for transfers and assignments of construction permits or station licenses, Petitions to Deny must be filed not later than 30 days after issuance of a public notice of the acceptance for filing of the applications. In the case of applications for renewal of license, Petitions to Deny may be filed at any time up to the deadline established in § 73.3516(e). Requests for extension of time to file Petitions to Deny applications for new broadcast stations or major changes in the facilities of existing stations or applications for renewal of license will not be granted unless all parties concerned, including the applicant, consent to such requests, or unless a compelling showing can be made that unusual circumstances make the filing of a timely petition impossible and the granting of an extension warranted.

(b) Except in the case of applications for new low power TV or TV translator stations, or for major changes in the existing facilities of such stations, the applicant may file an opposition to any Petition to Deny, and the Petitioner a reply to such opposition in which allegations of fact or denials thereof shall be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The times for filing such oppositions and replies shall be those provided in § 1.45 except that as to a Petition to Deny an application for renewal of license, an opposition thereto may be filed within 30 days after the Petition to Deny is filed, and the party that filed the Petition to Deny may reply to the opposition within 20 days after opposition is due or within 20 days after the opposition is filed, whichever is longer. The failure to file an opposition or a reply will not necessarily be construed as an admission of fact or argument contained in a pleading.

(c) In the case of applications for new low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster stations, for major changes in the existing facilities of such stations, or for applications for a change in output channel tendered by displaced low power TV and TV translator stations pursuant to § 73.3572(a)(1), any party in interest may file with the FCC a Petition to Deny any applcation (whether as originally filed or if amended so as to require a new file number pursuant to § 73.3572(b)) for which local notice pursuant to § 73.3580 is required, provided such petitions are filed within 30 days of the FCC Public Notice proposing the application for grant (applicants may file oppositions within 15 days after the Petition to Deny is filed); but where the FCC selects a tentative permittee pursuant to Section 1.1601 et seq., Petitions to Deny shall be accepted only if directed against the tentative selectee and filed after issuance of and within 15 days of FCC Public Notice announcing the tentative selectee. The applicant may file an opposition within 15 days after the Petition to Deny is filed. In cases in which the minimum diversity preference provided for in § 1.1623(f)(1) has been applied, an “objection to diversity claim” and opposition thereto, may be filed against any applicant receiving a diversity preference, within the same time period provided herein for Petitions and Oppositions. In all pleadings, allegations of fact or denials thereof shall be supported by appropriate certification. However, the FCC may announce, by the Public Notice announcing the acceptance of the last-filed mutually exclusive application, that a notice of Petition to Deny will be required to be filed no later than 30 days after issuance of the Public Notice.

(d) A party in interest may file a Petition to Deny any application that proposes reclassification of a Class C authorization to Class C0 not later than 30 days after issuance of an order to show cause by the Commission notifying the affected licensee of the proposed reclassification.

(e) Untimely Petitions to Deny, as well as other pleadings in the nature of a Petition to Deny, and any other pleadings or supplements which do not lie as a matter of law or are otherwise procedurally defective, are subject to return by the FCC's staff without consideration.
