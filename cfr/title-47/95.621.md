(a) The GMRS transmitter channel frequencies (reference frequencies from which the carrier frequency, suppressed or otherwise, may not deviate by more than the specified frequency tolerance) are 462.5500, 462.5625, 462.5750, 462.5875, 462.6000, 462.6125, 462.6250, 462.6375, 462.6500, 462.6625, 462.6750, 462.6875, 462.7000, 462.7125, 462.7250, 467.5500, 467.5750, 467.6000, 467.6250, 467.6500, 467.6750, 467.7000, and 467.7250.
                                    

(b) Each GMRS transmitter for mobile station, small base station and control station operation must be maintained within a frequency tolerance of 0.0005%. Each GMRS transmitter for base station (except small base), mobile relay station or fixed station operation must be maintained within a frequency tolerance of 0.00025%.
