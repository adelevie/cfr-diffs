MVDDS licensees are not required to provide all local television channels to subscribers within its area and thus are not required to comply with the must-carry rules, nor the local signal carriage requirements of the Rural Local Broadcast Signal Act. See Multichannel Video and Cable Television Service Rules, Subpart D (Carriage of Television Broadcast Signals), 47 CFR 76.51-76.70. If an MVDDS licensee meets the statutory definition of Multiple Video Programming Distributor (MVPD), the retransmission consent requirement of section 325(b)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1)) shall apply to that MVDDS licensee. Any MVDDS licensee that is an MVPD must obtain the prior express authority of a broadcast station before retransmitting that station's signal, subject to the exceptions contained in section 325(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 325(b)(2)). Network nonduplication, syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and leased access rules shall not be imposed on MVDDS licensees.
