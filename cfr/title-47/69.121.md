(a) Appropriate connection charge subelements shall be established for the use of equipment and facilities that are associated with offerings of expanded interconnection for special access and switched transport services, as defined in part 64, subpart N of this chapter.

Charges for the cross-connect subelement shall not be deaveraged within a study area that is used for purposes of jurisdictional separations.

(2) Charges for subelements associated with physical collocation or virtual collocation, other than the subelement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and subelements recovering the cost of the virtual collocation equipment described in ยง 64.1401(e)(1) of this chapter, may reasonably differ in different central offices, notwithstanding ยง 69.3(e)(7).

(b) Connection charge subelements shall be computed based upon the costs associated with the equipment and facilities that are included in such subelements, including no more than a just and reasonable portion of the telephone company's overhead costs.

(c) Connection charge subelements shall be assessed upon all interconnectors that use the equipment or facilities that are included in such subelements.
