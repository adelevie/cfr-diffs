(a) General. This section contains the technical criteria for evaluating applications requesting DTV facilities that do not conform to the provisions of § 73.622 and petitions for rule making to amend the pre-transition DTV Table of Allotments (§ 73.622(b)). Petitions to amend the DTV Table (other than those also expressly requesting amendment of this section) and applications for new DTV broadcast stations or for changes in authorized DTV stations filed pursuant to this section will not be accepted for filing if they fail to comply with the requirements of this section. Petitions for rule making and applications seeking facilities that will operate after the end of the DTV transition must also comply with § 73.616.

(b) In considering petitions to amend the DTV Table and applications filed pursuant to this section, the Commission will use geographic coordinates defined in § 73.622(d) as reference points in determining allotment separations and evaluating interference potential.

(c) Minimum technical criteria for modification of DTV allotments included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments and for applications filed pursuant to this section. No petition to modify a channel allotment included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments or application for authority to construct or modify a DTV station assigned to such an allotment, filed pursuant to this section, will be accepted unless it shows compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.

(1) Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a).

(2) Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate that the requested change would not result in more than an additional 2 percent the population served by another station being subject to interference; provided, however, that no new interference may be caused to any station that already experiences interference to 10 percent or more of its population or that would result in a station receiving interference in excess of 10 percent of its population. The station population values for existing NTSC service and DTV service contained in Appendix B of the Memorandum Opinion and Order on Reconsideration of the Sixth Report and Order in MM Docket No. 87-268, FCC 98-24, adopted January 29, 1998, referenced in § 73.622(c), are to be used for the purposes of determining whether a power increase or other change is permissible under this de minimis standard. For evaluating compliance with this requirement, interference to populations served is to be predicted based on the procedure set forth in OET Bulletin No. 69, including population served within service areas determined in accordance with section 73.622(e), consideration of whether F(50,10) undesired signals will exceed the following desired-to-undesired (D/U) signal ratios, assumed use of a directional receiving antenna, and use of the terrain dependent Longley-Rice point-to-point propagation model. Copies of OET Bulletin No. 69 may be inspected during normal business hours at the: Federal Communications Commission, Room CY-C203, 445 12th Street, SW., Reference Information Center, Washington, DC 20554. These documents are also available through the Internet on the FCC Home Page at http://www.fcc.gov. The threshold levels at which interference is considered to occur are:

(3) The values in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for co-channel interference to DTV service are only valid at locations where the signal-to-noise ratio is 28 dB or greater for interference from DTV and 25 dB or greater for interference from analog TV service. At the edge of the noise-limited service area, where the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is 16 dB, these values are 21 dB and 23 dB for interference from analog TV and DTV, respectively. At locations where the S/N ratio is greater than 16 dB but less than 28 dB, D/U values for co-channel interference to DTV are as follows:

(i) For DTV-to-DTV interference, the minimum D/U ratios are computed from the following formula:
              

(ii) For analog-to-DTV interference, the minimum D/U ratios are found from the following Table (for values between measured values, linear interpolation can be used):

(4) Due to the frequency spacing that exists between Channels 4 and 5, between Channels 6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14, the minimum adjacent channel technical criteria specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not be applicable to these pairs of channels (see § 73.603(a)).

(5) A DTV station application that proposes to expand the DTV station's allotted or authorized coverage area in any direction will not be accepted if it is predicted to cause interference to a Class A TV station or to a digital Class A TV station authorized pursuant to Subpart J of this part, within the protected contour defined in § 73.6010 of this part. This paragraph applies to all DTV applications filed after May 1, 2000, and to DTV applications filed between December 31, 1999 and April 30, 2000 unless the DTV station licensee or permittee notified the Commission of its intent to “maximize” by December 31, 1999.

(i) Interference is predicted to occur if the ratio in dB of the field strength of a Class A TV station at its protected contour to the field strength resulting from the facilities proposed in the DTV application (calculated using the appropriate F(50,10) chart from Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of § 73.699 of this part) fails to meet the D/U signal ratios for “DTV-into-analog TV” specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

(ii) Interference is predicted to occur if the ratio in dB of the field strength of a digital Class A TV station at its protected contour to the field strength resulting from the facilities proposed in the DTV application (calculated using the appropriate F(50,10) chart from Figure 9a, 10a, or 10c of § 73.699 of this part) fails to meet the D/U signal ratios for “DTV-into-DTV” specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.

(iii) In support of a request for waiver of the interference protection requirements of this section, an applicant for a DTV broadcast station may make full use of terrain shielding and Longley-Rice terrain dependent propagation methods to demonstrate that the proposed facility would not be likely to cause interference to Class A TV stations. Guidance on using the Longely-Rice methodology is provided in OET Bulletin No. 69, which is available through the Internet at http://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/documents/bulletins/#69.
                
              

(d) Minimum geographic spacing requirements for DTV allotments not included in the initial DTV Table of Allotments. No petition to add a new channel to the DTV Table of Allotments or modify an allotment not included in the initial DTV Table will be accepted unless it shows compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.

(1) Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must demonstrate compliance with the principle community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a).

(2) Requests filed pursuant to this paragraph must meet the following requirements for geographic spacing with regard to all other DTV stations, DTV allotments and analog TV stations:

(3) Zones are defined in § 73.609. The minimum distance separation between a DTV station in one zone and an analog TV or DTV station in another zone shall be that of the zone requiring the lower separation.

(4) Due to the frequency spacing that exists between Channels 4 and 5, between Channels 6 and 7, and between Channels 13 and 14, the minimum geographic spacing requirements specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall not be applicable to these pairs of channels (§ 73.603(a)).

(e) Protection of land mobile operations on channels 14-20. The Commission will not accept petitions to amend the DTV Table of Allotments, applications for new DTV stations, or applications to change the channel or location of authorized DTV stations that would use channels 14-20 where the distance between the DTV reference point as defined in section 73.622(d), would be located less than 250 km from the city center of a co-channel land mobile operation or 176 km from the city center of an adjacent channel land mobile operation. Petitions to amend the DTV Table, applications for new DTV stations, or requests to modify the DTV Table that do not meet the minimum DTV-to-land mobile spacing standards will, however, be considered where all affected land mobile licensees consent to the requested action. Land mobile operations are authorized on these channels in the following markets:
              

(f) Parties requesting new allotments on channel 6 be added to the DTV Table must submit an engineering study demonstrating that no interference would be caused to existing FM radio stations on FM channels 200-220.

(g) Negotiated agreements on interference. Notwithstanding the minimum technical criteria for DTV allotments specified above, DTV stations operating on allotments that are included in the initial DTV Table may: operate with increased ERP and/or antenna HAAT that would result in additional interference to another DTV station or an analog TV station if that station agrees, in writing, to accept the additional interference; and/or implement an exchange of channel allotments between two or more licensees or permittees of TV stations in the same community, the same market, or in adjacent markets provided, however, that the other requirements of this section and of section 73.622 are met with respect to each such application. Such agreements must be submitted with the application for authority to construct or modify the affected DTV station or stations. The larger service area resulting from a negotiated change in ERP and/or antenna HAAT will be protected in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. Negotiated agreements under this paragraph can include the exchange of money or other considerations from one station to another, including payments to and from noncommercial television stations assigned reserved channels. Applications submitted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph will be granted only if the Commission finds that such action is consistent with the public interest.
