You must not use an R/C station—

(a) In connection with any activity which is against federal, state or local law;

(b) To transmit any message other than for operation of devices at remote locations (no voice, telegraphy, etc.);

(c) To intentionally interfere with another station's transmissions;

(d) To operate another R/C transmitter by remote control (See R/C Rule 17, § 95.217); or

(e) To transmit two-way communications.

(f) To transmit data. Tone or other signal encoding, however, is not considered to be data when only used either for the purpose of identifying the specific device among multiple devices that the operator intends to turn on/off, or the specific sensor among multiple sensors intended to turn on/off indicating device for the operator.
