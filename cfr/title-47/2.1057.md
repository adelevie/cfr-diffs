(a) In all of the measurements set forth in §§ 2.1051 and 2.1053, the spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest radio frequency signal generated in the equipment, without going below 9 kHz, up to at least the frequency shown below:

(1) If the equipment operates below 10 GHz: to the tenth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 40 GHz, whichever is lower.

(2) If the equipment operates at or above 10 GHz and below 30 GHz: to the fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 100 GHz, whichever is lower.

(3) If the equipment operates at or above 30 GHz: to the fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 200 GHz, whichever is lower.

(b) Particular attention should be paid to harmonics and subharmonics of the carrier frequency as well as to those frequencies removed from the carrier by multiples of the oscillator frequency. Radiation at the frequencies of multiplier stages should also be checked.

(c) The amplitude of spurious emissions which are attenuated more than 20 dB below the permissible value need not be reported.

(d) Unless otherwise specified, measurements above 40 GHz shall be performed using a minimum resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz.
