The Commission may attempt to effect compromise, preferably during the course of personal interviews, in accordance with the standards set forth in part 902 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (31 CFR part 902). The Commission will also consider a request submitted by the debtor to compromise the debt. Such requests should be submitted in writing with full justification of the offer and addressing the bases for compromise at 31 CFR 902.2. Debtors will provide full financial information to support any request for compromise based on the debtor's inability to pay the debt. Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the Department of Justice. The Commission will evaluate an offer, using the factors set forth in 31 CFR 902.2 and, as appropriate, refer the offer with the appropriate financial information to the Department of Justice. Department of Justice approval is not required if the Commission rejects a compromise offer.
