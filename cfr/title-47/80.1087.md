This section contains the additional equipment requirements for ships that remain within sea area A1 at all times.

(a) In addition to meeting the requirements of ยง 80.1085, ships engaged on voyages exclusively in sea area A1 must be provided with a radio installation capable of initiating the transmission of ship-to-shore distress alerts from the position from which the ship is normally navigated, operating either:

(1) On VHF using DSC; or

(2) Through the polar orbiting satellite service on 406.0-406.1 MHz (this requirement may be fulfilled by the EPIRB required by ยง 80.1085(a)(6), either by installing the EPIRB close to, or by allowing remote activation from, the position from which the ship is normally navigated); or

(3) On MF using DSC if the ship is engaged on voyages within coverage of MF coast stations equipped with DSC; or

(4) On HF using DSC; or

(5) Through the INMARSAT geostationary satellite service if within INMARSAT coverage. This requirement may be fulfilled by an INMARSAT ship earth station capable of two way communication.

(b) The VHF radio installation, required by ยง 80.1085(a)(1), must also be capable of transmitting and receiving general radio-communications using radiotelephony.
