Under this load condition the voltage of the source of energy at the power input terminals of the VHF radiotelephone installation must not deviate from its rated value by more than 10 percent on ships completed on or after March 1, 1957, nor by more than 15 percent on ships completed before that date.

(b) When the power supply for the VHF radiotelephone installation consists of batteries, they must be installed in the upper part of the ship, secured against shifting with motion of the ship, capable of operating the installation for 6 hours, and accessible with not less than 26 cm (10 in.) head room.

(c) Means must be provided for charging any rechargeable batteries used in the ship's VHF radiotelephone installation. There must be provided a device which, during charging of the batteries, will give a continuous indication of the charging current.

(d) The VHF radiotelephone installation may be connected to the reserve power supply of a compulsorily fitted radiotelephone or radiotelegraph installation.
