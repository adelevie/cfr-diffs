(a) The licensee of a station using a directional antenna during daytime or nighttime hours may, without further authority, operate during daytime hours with the licensed nighttime directional facilities or with a nondirectional antenna when conducting monitoring point field strength measurements or antenna proof of performance measurements.

(b) Operation pursuant to this section is subject to the following conditions:

(1) No harmful interference will be caused to any other station.

(2) The FCC may notify the licensee to modify or cease such operation to resolve interference complaints or when such action may appear to be in the public interest, convenience and necessity.

(3) Such operation shall be undertaken only for the purpose of taking monitoring point field strength measurements or antenna proof of performance measurements, and shall be restricted to the minimum time required to accomplish the measurements.

(4) Operating power in the nondirectional mode shall be adjusted to the same power as was utilized for the most recent nondirectional proof of performance covering the licensed facilities.
