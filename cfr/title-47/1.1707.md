Regardless of filing method, all submissions with an insufficient fee, grossly deficient or inaccurate information, or those without a valid signature will be dismissed immediately. For any submission that is found subsequently to have minimally deficient or inaccurate information, we will notify the filer of the defect. We will allow 15 days from the date of this notification for correction or amendment of the submission if the amendment is minor. If the applicant files a timely corrected application, it will ordinarily be processed as a minor amendment in accordance with the Commission's rules. Thus it will have no effect on the initial filing date of the application or the applicant's filing priority. If, however, the amendment made by the applicant is not a simple correction, but constitutes a major amendment to the application, it will be governed by the rules and procedures applicable to major amendments, that is, it will be treated as a new application with a new filing date and new fees must be paid by the applicant. Finally, if the applicant fails to submit an amended application within the period specified in the notification, the application will be subject to dismissal for failure to prosecute.
