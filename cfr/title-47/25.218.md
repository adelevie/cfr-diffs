(a) This section applies to all earth station applications, except for:

(1) ESV and VMES applications,

(2) Analog video earth station applications,

(3) Applications for feeder-link earth stations in the 17/24 GHz BSS.

(b) Earth station applications subject to this section are eligible for routine processing if they meet the applicable off-axis EIRP envelope set forth in this section below. For purposes of this section, the term “extended Ku-band” is the 10.7 through 11.7 GHz, 12.75 through 13.25 GHz, and 13.75 through 14.0 GHz band. The term “conventional Ku-band” is defined in § 25.201 of this chapter.

(c) C-band analog earth station operations. (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears at the particular earth station location:

(2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:

(d) C-band digital earth station operations. (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears at the particular earth station location:
              

(2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:

(e) Conventional Ku-band analog earth station operations. (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears at the particular earth station location:

(2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:

(f) Conventional Ku-band digital earth station operations. (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears at the particular earth station location:

(2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:

(g) Extended Ku-band analog earth station operations. (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears at the particular earth station location:

(2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:

(h) Extended Ku-band digital earth station operations. (1) In the plane of the geostationary satellite orbit as it appears at the particular earth station location:

(2) In all other directions, or in the plane of the horizon including any out-of-plane potential terrestrial interference paths:
