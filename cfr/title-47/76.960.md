Upon a finding that a rate for cable programming service or associated equipment is unreasonable, the Commission may order the cable operator to implement a prospective rate reduction to the class of customers subscribing to the cable programming service at issue.

(a) For an operator that adjusts its rates using the quarterly rate adjustment system pursuant to Section 76.922(d), the Commission's decision regarding a prospective rate reduction shall remain binding on the cable operator for one year unless the Commission specifies otherwise.

(b) For an operator that adjusts its rates using the annual rate adjustment system pursuant to Section 76.922(e), for one year following the Commission's decision, the operator shall provide the Commission at least 30 days' notice of any proposed change.
