(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no license for an LPFM station shall be granted to any party if the grant of such authorization will result in the same party holding an attributable interest in any other non-LPFM broadcast station, including any FM translator or low power television station, or any other media subject to our broadcast ownership restrictions.

(b) A party with an attributable interest in a broadcast radio station must divest such interest prior to the commencement of operations of an LPFM station in which the party also holds an interest unless such party is a college or university that can certify that the existing broadcast radio station is not student run. This exception applies only to parties that;

(1) Are accredited educational institutions, and;

(2) Own attributable interest in non-student run broadcast stations;

(3) Apply for an authorization for an LPFM station that will be managed and operated on a day-to-day basis by students of the accredited educational institution; and

(4) Do not face competing applications for the LPFM authorization.

(c) No LPFM licensee may enter into an operating agreement of any type, including a time brokerage or management agreement, with either a full power broadcast station or another LPFM station.
