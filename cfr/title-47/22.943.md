Except as otherwise provided in this section, the FCC does not accept applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular system that has been acquired by the current licensee for the first time as a result of a comparative renewal proceeding until the system has provided service to subscribers for at least three years.

(a) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular system that is to be transferred as a part of a bona fide sale of an on-going business to which the cellular operation is incidental.

(b) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular system that is to be transferred as a result of the death of the licensee.
              

(c) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of authorization if the transfer or assignment is pro forma and does not involve a change in ownership.
