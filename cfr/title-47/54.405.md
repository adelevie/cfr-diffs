All eligible telecommunications carriers shall:

(a) Make available one Lifeline service, as defined in § 54.401, per qualifying low-income consumer that is not currently receiving Lifeline service from that or any other eligible telecommunications carrier, and

(b) Publicize the availability of Lifeline service in a manner reasonably designed to reach those likely to qualify for the service.

(c) Notify Lifeline subscribers of impending termination of Lifeline service if the carrier has a reasonable basis to believe that the subscriber no longer meets the Lifeline-qualifying criteria, as described in § 54.409. Notification of impending termination shall be in the form of a letter separate from the subscriber's monthly bill. A carrier providing Lifeline service in a state that has dispute resolution procedures applicable to Lifeline termination, that requires, at a minimum, written notification of impending termination, must comply with the applicable state requirements.

(d) Allow subscribers 60 days following the date of the impending termination letter required in paragraph (c) of this section in which to demonstrate continued eligibility. Subscribers making such a demonstration must present proof of continued eligibility to the carrier consistent with applicable state or federal verification requirements, as described in § 54.410(c). Carriers must terminate subscribers who fail to demonstrate continued eligibility within the 60-day time period. A carrier providing Lifeline service in a state that has dispute resolution procedures applicable to Lifeline termination must comply with the applicable state requirements.

(e) De-enrollment. Notwithstanding § 54.405(c) and (d) of this section, upon notification by the Administrator to any ETC in any state that a subscriber is receiving Lifeline service from another eligible telecommunications carrier and should be de-enrolled from participation in that ETC's Lifeline program, the ETC shall de-enroll the subscriber from participation in that ETC's Lifeline program within 5 business days. An ETC shall not be eligible for Lifeline reimbursement as described in §§ 54.403 and 54.407 for any de-enrolled subscriber following the date of that subscriber's de-enrollment.
