(a) Before designation for hearing. Any application not designated for hearing may be dismissed without prejudice at any time upon request of the applicant. An applicant's request for the return of an application that has been accepted for filing and consideration, but not designated for hearing, will be deemed a request for dismissal without prejudice.
