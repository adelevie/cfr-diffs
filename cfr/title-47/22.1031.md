The FCC may, upon proper application therefor, authorize the construction and operation of temporary fixed stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone service to be used only when the service of permanent fixed stations is disrupted by storms or emergencies or is otherwise unavailable.

(a) Six month limitation. If it is necessary for a temporary fixed station to remain at the same location for more than six months, the licensee of that station must apply for authorization to operate the station at the specific location at least 30 days before the end of the six month period.

(b) International communications. Communications between the United States and Mexico must not be carried using a temporary fixed station without prior authorization from the FCC. Licensees desiring to carry such communications should apply sufficiently in advance to allow for the time necessary to coordinate with Canada or Mexico.
