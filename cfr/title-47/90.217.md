Except as noted herein, transmitters used at stations licensed below 800 MHz on any frequency listed in subparts B and C of this part or licensed on a business category channel above 800 MHz which have an output power not exceeding 120 milliwatts are exempt from the technical requirements set out in this subpart, but must instead comply with the following:

(a) For equipment designed to operate with a 25 kHz channel bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that any emission appearing on a frequency 40 kHz or more removed from the assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated carrier.

(b) For equipment designed to operate with a 12.5 kHz channel bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that any emission appearing on a frequency 25 kHz or more removed from the assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated carrier.
                          

(c) For equipment designed to operate with a 6.25 kHz channel bandwidth, the sum of the bandwidth occupied by the emitted signal plus the bandwidth required for frequency stability shall be adjusted so that any emission appearing on a frequency 12.5 kHz or more removed from the assigned frequency is attenuated at least 30 dB below the unmodulated carrier.

(d) Transmitters may be operated in the continuous carrier transmit mode.

(e) Transmitters used for wireless microphone operations and operating on frequencies allocated for Federal use must comply with the requirements of § 90.265(b).
