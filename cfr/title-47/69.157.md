To the extent that the costs of ISDN line ports, and line ports associated with other services, exceed the costs of a line port used for basic, analog service, local exchange carriers may recover the difference through a separate monthly end-user charge. As of June 30, 2000, these rates will be capped until June 30, 2005.
