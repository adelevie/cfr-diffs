Testing of an EPIRB for compliance outside a shielded room on a distress frequency is prohibited, since this may interfere with emergency communications. Therefore, all compliance testing outside a shielded room should be conducted on one of the pairs of alternate frequencies specified below:
                                    

(a) The testing shall not cause harmful interference to authorized communications on these frequencies.

(b) The testing shall be coordinated with the nearest FCC district office.
