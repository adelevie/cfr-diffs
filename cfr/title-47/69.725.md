If a price cap LEC elects to show, in accordance with ยง 69.709 or ยง 69.711, that competitors have collocated in wire centers accounting for a certain percentage of revenues from the services at issue, the LEC must make the following revenue allocations:

(a) For entrance facilities and channel terminations between an IXC POP and a serving wire center, the petitioner shall attribute all the revenue to the serving wire center.

(b) For channel terminations between a LEC end office and a customer premises, the petitioner shall attribute all the revenue to the LEC end office.

(c) For any dedicated service routed through multiple wire centers, the petitioner shall attribute 50 percent of the revenue to the wire center at each end of the transmission path, unless the petitioner can make a convincing case in its petition that some other allocation would be more representative of the extent of competitive entry in the MSA or the non-MSA parts of the study area at issue.
