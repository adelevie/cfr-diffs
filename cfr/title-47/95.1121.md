Due to the critical nature of communications transmitted under this part, the frequency coordinator in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration shall determine whether there are any Federal Government systems whose operations could affect, or could be affected by, proposed wireless medical telemetry operations in the 1395-1400 MHz and 1427-1432 MHz bands. The locations of government systems in these bands are specified in footnotes US351 and US352 of ยง 2.106 of this chapter.
