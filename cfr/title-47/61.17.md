(a) An application for special permission filed electronically must be addressed to “Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.” The Electronic Tariff Filing System will accept filings 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The official filing date of a publication received by the Electronic Tariff Filing System will be determined by the date and time the transmission ends. If the transmission ends after the close of a business day, as that term is defined in § 1.4(e)(2) of this chapter, the filing will be date and time stamped as of the opening of the next business day.

(b) In addition, except for issuing carriers filing tariffing fees electronically, for special permission applications requiring fees as set forth in part 1, subpart G of this chapter, issuing carriers must submit the original of the application letter (without attachments), FCC Form 159, and the appropriate fee to the U.S. Bank, St. Louis, Missouri, at the address set forth in § 1.1105 of this chapter. Issuing carriers submitting tariffing fees electronically should submit a copy of the Form 159 and the original application letter to the Secretary of the Commission in lieu of the U.S. Bank.

Issuing carriers should submit these fee materials on the same day as the transmission in paragraph (a) of this section.

Applications must be numbered consecutively in a series separate from FCC tariff numbers, bear the signature of the officer or agent of the carrier, and be in the following format:
