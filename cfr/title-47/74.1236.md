(a) The license of a station authorized under this subpart allows the transmission of either F3 or other types of frequency modulation (see ยง 2.201 of this chapter) upon a showing of need, as long as the emission complies with the following:

(1) For transmitter output powers no greater than 10 watts, paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section apply.

(2) For transmitter output powers greater than 10 watts, ยง 73.317 (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply.

(b) Standard width FM channels will be assigned and the transmitting apparatus shall be operated so as to limit spurious emissions to the lowest practicable value. Any emissions including intermodulation products and radiofrequency harmonics which are not essential for the transmission of the desired aural information shall be considered to be spurious emissions.

(c) The power of emissions appearing outside the assigned channel shall be attenuated below the total power of the emission as follows:
              

(d) Greater attenuation than that specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be required if interference results outside the assigned channel.
