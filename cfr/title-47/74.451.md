(b) Any manufacturer of a transmitter to be used in this service may apply for certification for such transmitter following the certification procedure set forth in part 2 of the Commission's rules and regulations. Attention is also directed to part 1 of the Commission's rules and regulations which specifies the fees required when filing an application for certification.

(e) Remote pickup broadcast station equipment authorized to be used pursuant to an application accepted for filing prior to December 1, 1977, may continue to be used by the licensee or its successors or assignees: Provided, however, If operation of such equipment causes harmful interference due to its failure to comply with the technical standards set forth in this subpart, the Commission may, at its discretion, require the licensee to take such corrective action as is necessary to eliminate the interference.

(f) Each instrument of authority which permits operation of a remote pickup broadcast station or system using equipment which has not been certificated will specify the particular transmitting equipment which the licensee is authorized to use.
