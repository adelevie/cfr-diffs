Devices subject only to verification shall be uniquely identified by the person responsible for marketing or importing the equipment within the United States. However, the identification shall not be of a format which could be confused with the FCC Identifier required on certified, notified or type accepted equipment. The importer or manufacturer shall maintain adequate identification records to facilitate positive identification for each verified device.
