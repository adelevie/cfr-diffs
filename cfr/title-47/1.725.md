Cross-complaints seeking any relief within the jurisdiction of the Commission against any carrier that is a party (complainant or defendant) to that proceeding are expressly prohibited. Any claim that might otherwise meet the requirements of a cross-complaint may be filed as a separate complaint in accordance with §§ 1.720 through 1.736. For purposes of this subpart, the term “cross-complaint” shall include counterclaims.
