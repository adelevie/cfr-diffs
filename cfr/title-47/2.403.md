Any station which becomes aware that a mobile station is in distress may transmit the distress message in the following cases:

(a) When the station in distress is not itself in a position to transmit the message.

(b) In the case of mobile stations, when the master or the person in charge of the ship, aircraft, or other vehicles carrying the station which intervenes believes that further help is necessary.

(c) In the case of other stations, when directed to do so by the station in control of distress traffic or when it has reason to believe that a distress call which it has intercepted has not been received by any station in a position to render aid.
