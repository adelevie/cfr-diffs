Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing system that abuts the unserved area, must propose a contiguous cellular geographical service area (CGSA) of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles). Area within contract SAB extensions counts toward the minimum coverage requirement. However, area within de minimis SAB extensions does not count toward the minimum coverage requirement. Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing system that abuts the unserved area, must not propose coverage of water areas only (or water areas and uninhabited islands or reefs only), except for unserved areas in the Gulf of Mexico MSA.
