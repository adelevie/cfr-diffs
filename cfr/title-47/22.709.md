In addition to information required by Subparts B and D of this part, FCC Form 601 applications for authorization to operate a station in the Rural Radiotelephone Service must contain the applicable supplementary information described in this section.

(a) Interoffice stations. Applications for authority to operate a new interoffice station or to add transmitters or points of communications to an existing interoffice station must contain an exhibit demonstrating that the requested facilities would be used only for interconnecting central office stations and explaining why the use of alternative existing radio or wire facilities is not feasible.

(b) Technical information required. For each transmitter in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the following information is required by FCC Form 601:

(1) Location description: city; county; state; geographic coordinates correct to ±1 second, the datum used (NAD83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent market boundaries and international borders;

(2) Antenna height to tip above ground level, the height of the center of radiation of the antenna above the average terrain, the height of the antenna center of radiation above the average elevation of the terrain along each of the 8 cardinal radials, antenna gain in the maximum lobe, the beamwidth of the maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar plot of the horizontal gain pattern of the antenna, the electric field polarization of the wave emitted by the antenna when installed as proposed;

(3) The center frequency of each channel requested, the maximum effective radiated power, the effective radiated power in each of the cardinal radial directions, any non-standard emission types to be used, including bandwidth and modulation type, the transmitter classification (e.g. central office), and the locations and call signs, if any, of any fixed points of communication.

(c) No landline facilities. Each application for a central office station must contain an exhibit showing that it is impracticable to provide the required communication service by means of landline facilities.

(d) Interference exhibit. Applications for central office, interoffice and relay stations must include an exhibit identifying co-channel facilities and demonstrating, in accordance with § 22.715 that the proposed station, if authorized, would not cause interference to the service of those co-channel facilities. This exhibit must:

(1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System central office transmitter in the rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers (144 miles).

(2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 kilometers (58 miles) or less, and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).

(3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of distance calculations indicating that there would be no overlap of service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the licensee of or applicant for the protected transmitter and/or the applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any interference resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.
                      

(e) Blocking probability. Applications for authority to operate basic exchange telephone radio systems (BETRS) that request more than two channel pairs must include an exhibit containing calculations showing that the number of channels requested is the minimum necessary to achieve the required grade of service (in terms of blocking probability), and that there will be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic estimates of current and future demand for paging, two-way mobile and rural radiotelephone services (see § 22.719(c)). Applications for authority to operate new conventional rural radiotelephone systems that request more than two channel pairs must include a statement explaining why BETRS technology is not being proposed.

(f) Antenna Information. Upon request by an applicant, licensee, or the Commission, a part 22 applicant or licensee of whom the request is made shall furnish the antenna type, model, and the name of the antenna manufacturer to the requesting party within ten (10) days of receiving written notification.
