Should terminal equipment, inside wiring, plugs and jacks, or protective circuitry cause harm to the public switched telephone network, or should the provider of wireline telecommunications reasonably determine that such harm is imminent, the provider of wireline telecommunications shall, where practicable, notify the customer that temporary discontinuance of service may be required; however, wherever prior notice is not practicable, the provider of wireline telecommunications may temporarily discontinue service forthwith, if such action is reasonable under the circumstances. In case of such temporary discontinuance, the provider of wireline telecommunications shall:

(a) Promptly notify the customer of such temporary discontinuance;

(b) Afford the customer the opportunity to correct the situation which gave rise to the temporary discontinuance; and

(c) Inform the customer of his right to bring a complaint to the Commission pursuant to the procedures set forth in subpart E of this part.
