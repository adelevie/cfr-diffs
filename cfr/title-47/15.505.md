(a) Except where specifically stated otherwise within this subpart, the provisions of subparts A and B and of §§ 15.201 through 15.204 and 15.207 of subpart C of this part apply to unlicensed UWB intentional radiators. The provisions of § 15.35(c) and 15.205 do not apply to devices operated under this subpart. The provisions of Footnote US 246 to the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in § 2.106 of this chapter does not apply to devices operated under this subpart.

(b) The requirements of this subpart apply only to the radio transmitter, i.e., the intentional radiator, contained in the UWB device. Other aspects of the operation of a UWB device may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter. In particular, a UWB device that contains digital circuitry not directly associated with the operation of the transmitter also is subject to the requirements for unintentional radiators in subpart B of this part. Similarly, an associated receiver that operates (tunes) within the frequency range 30 MHz to 960 MHz is subject to the requirements in subpart B of this part.
