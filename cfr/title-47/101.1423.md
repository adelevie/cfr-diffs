Pursuant to § 2.301 of this chapter, MVDDS systems in the United States within 56 km (35 miles) of the Canadian and Mexican border will be granted conditional licenses, until final international agreements are approved. These systems may not cause harmful interference to stations in Canada or Mexico. MVDDS stations must comply with the procedures outlined under §§ 101.147(p) and 1.928(f)(1) and (f)(2) of this chapter until final international agreements concerning MVDDS are signed. Section 1.928(f) of this chapter states that transmitting antennas can be located as close as five miles (eight kilometers) of the border if they point within a sector of 160 degrees away from the border, and as close as thirty-five miles (fifty-six km) of the border if they point within a sector of 200 degrees toward the border without coordination with Canada. MVDDS licensees shall apply this method near the Canadian and Mexican borders. No stations are allowed within 5 miles of the borders.
