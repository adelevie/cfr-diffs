If the Commission determines not to amend a record consistent with an individual's request, and if the individual files a statement of disagreement pursuant to ยง 0.557(d)(2), the Commission shall clearly annotate the record so that the disputed portion becomes apparent to anyone who may subsequently have access to, use or disclose the record. A copy of the individual's statement of disagreement shall accompany any subsequent disclosure of the record. In addition, the Commission may include a brief summary of its reasons for not amending the record when disclosing the record. Such statements become part of the individual's record for granting access, but are not subject to the amendment procedures of ยง 0.556.
