(a) This account shall include amounts determined in accordance with § 32.2000(b) of this subpart representing the difference between (1) the fair market value of the telecommunications plant acquired, plus preliminary expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition; and (2) the original cost of such plant, governmental franchises and similar rights acquired, less the amounts of reserve requirements for depreciation and amortization of the property acquired. If the actual original cost is not known, the entries in this account shall be based upon an estimate of such costs.

(1) Debit amounts may be charged in whole or in part, or amortized over a reasonable period through charges to Account 7300, Nonoperating income and expense, without further direction or approval by this Commission. When specifically approved by this Commission, or when the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply, debit amounts shall be amortized to Account 6565, Amortization expense—other.

(2) Credit amounts shall be disposed of in such manner as this Commission may approve or direct, except for credit amounts referred to in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(3) The amortization associated with the costs recorded in the Telecommunications plant adjustment account will be charged or credited, as appropriate, directly to this asset account, leaving a balance representing the unamortized cost.

(4) Within one year from the date of inclusion in this account of a debit or credit amount with respect to a current acquisition, the company may dispose of the total amount from an acquisition of telephone plant by a lump-sum charge or credit, as appropriate, to Account 6565 without further approval of this Commission, provided that such amount does not exceed $100,000 and that the plant was not acquired from an affiliated company.
