All written comments and suggestions received from the public by licensees of commercial AM, FM, TV and Class A TV broadcast stations regarding operation of their station shall be maintained in the local public inspection file, unless the letter writer has requested that the letter not be made public or when the licensee feels that it should be excluded from the public inspection file because of the nature of its content, such as a defamatory or obscene letter.

(a) Letters shall be retained in the local public inspection file for three years from the date on which they are received by the licensee.

(b) Letters received by TV and Class A TV licensees shall be placed in one of the following separated subject categories: programming or non-programming.
