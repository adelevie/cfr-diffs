(a) As used in this subpart, Lifeline means a retail local service offering:

(1) That is available only to qualifying low-income consumers;

(2) For which qualifying low-income consumers pay reduced charges as a result of application of the Lifeline support amount described in ยง 54.403; and

(3) That includes the services or functionalities enumerated in ยง 54.101 (a)(1) through (a)(9). The carriers shall offer toll limitation to all qualifying low-income consumers at the time such consumers subscribe to Lifeline service. If the consumer elects to receive toll limitation, that service shall become part of that consumer's Lifeline service.

(b) [Reserved

(c) Eligible telecommunications carriers may not collect a service deposit in order to initiate Lifeline service, if the qualifying low-income consumer voluntarily elects toll limitation service from the carrier, where available. If toll limitation services are unavailable, the carrier may charge a service deposit.

(d) The state commission shall file or require the eligible telecommunications carrier to file information with the Administrator demonstrating that the carrier's Lifeline plan meets the criteria set forth in this subpart and stating the number of qualifying low-income consumers and the amount of state assistance. Eligible telecommunications carriers not subject to state commission jurisdiction also shall make such a filing with the Administrator. Lifeline assistance shall be made available to qualifying low-income consumers as soon as the Administrator certifies that the carrier's Lifeline plan satisfies the criteria set out in this subpart.

(e) Consistent with ยง 52.33(a)(1)(i)(C), eligible telecommunications carriers may not charge Lifeline customers a monthly number-portability charge.
