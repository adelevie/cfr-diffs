(a) Supplier's Declaration of Conformity is a procedure where the responsible party, as defined in ยง 68.3, makes measurements or takes other necessary steps to ensure that the terminal equipment complies with the appropriate technical standards.

(b) The Supplier's Declaration of Conformity attaches to all items subsequently marketed by the responsible party which are identical, within the variation that can be expected to arise as a result of quantity production techniques, to the sample tested and found acceptable by the responsible party.

(c) The Supplier's Declaration of Conformity signifies that the responsible party has determined that the equipment has been shown to comply with the applicable technical criteria if no unauthorized change is made in the equipment and if the equipment is properly maintained and operated.

(d) The responsible party, if different from the manufacturer, may upon receiving a written statement from the manufacturer that the equipment complies with the appropriate technical criteria, rely on the manufacturer or independent testing agency to determine compliance. Any records that the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments requires the responsible party to maintain shall be in the English language and shall be made available to the Commission upon a request.

(e) No person shall use or make reference to a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity in a deceptive or misleading manner or to convey the impression that such a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity reflects more than a determination by the responsible party that the device or product has been shown to be capable of complying with the applicable technical criteria published by the Administrative Council of Terminal Attachments.
