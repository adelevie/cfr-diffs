(a) Frequencies allocated to broadcasting and the various categories of auxiliary stations, in the FCC's Table of Frequency Allocations (Part 2 of this chapter), may be assigned respectively to experimental broadcast and experimental auxiliary stations.

(b) More than one frequency may be assigned upon a satisfactory showing of the need therefor.

(c) Frequencies best suited to the purpose of the experimentation and on which there appears to be the least likelihood of interference to established stations shall be selected.

(d) In a case of important experimentation which cannot be feasibly conducted on frequencies allocated to broadcasting or the various categories of auxiliary stations, the FCC may authorize an experimental station of any class to operate on other frequencies upon a satisfactory showing of the need therefore and a showing that the proposed operation can be conducted without causing harmful interference to established services. However, experimental operation which looks toward the development of radio transmitting apparatus or the rendition of any type of regular service using such frequencies will not be authorized prior to a determination by the FCC that the development of such apparatus or the rendition of such service would serve the public interest.
