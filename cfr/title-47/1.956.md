Parties are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution procedures to settle disputes. See subpart E of this part. In any contested proceeding, the Commission, in its discretion, may direct the parties or their attorneys to appear before it for a conference.

(a) The purposes of such conferences are:

(1) To obtain admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties as to any or all of the matters in controversy;

(2) To consider the necessity for or desirability of amendments to the pleadings, or of additional pleadings or evidentiary submissions;

(3) To consider simplification or narrowing of the issues;

(4) To encourage settlement of the matters in controversy by agreement between the parties; and

(5) To consider other matters that may aid in the resolution of the contested proceeding.

(b) Conferences are scheduled by the Commission at a time and place it may designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone conference call.

(c) The failure of any party or attorney, following reasonable notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be deemed a failure to prosecute, subjecting that party's application or petition to dismissal by the Commission.
