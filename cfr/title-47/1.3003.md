No gift shall be accepted under this subpart unless a determination is made that its acceptance would not create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. In making conflict of interest determinations, designated agency ethics officials shall consider the following factors:

(a) Whether the benefits of the intended gift will accrue to an individual employee and, if soâ€”

(1) Whether the employee is responsible for matters affecting the potential donor that are currently before the agency; and

(2) The significance of the employee's role in any such matters;

(b) The nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the Commission affecting the intended donor;

(c) The timing of the intended gift;

(d) The market value of the intended gift;

(e) The frequency of other gifts made by the same donor; and

(f) The reason underlying the intended gift given in a written statement from the proposed donor.
