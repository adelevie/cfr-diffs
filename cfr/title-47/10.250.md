(b) For purposes of this section, a CMS provider that elects not to transmit CMAS Alert Messages, in part or in whole, shall use the notification language set forth in ยง 10.240 (c) or (d) respectively, except that the last line of the notice shall reference FCC Rule 47 CFR 10.250, rather than FCC Rule 47 CFR 10.240.

(c) In the case of prepaid customers, if a mailing address is available, the CMS provider shall provide the required notification via U.S. mail.
