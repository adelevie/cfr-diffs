(vi) The types and lengths of connecting cables used and how they were arranged or moved during testing;

(vii) At least two photographs showing the test set-up for the highest line conducted emission and showing the test set-up for the highest radiated emission. These photographs must be focused originals which show enough detail to confirm other information contained in the test report;

(viii) A description of any modifications made to the EUT by the testing company or individual to achieve compliance with the regulations;

(ix) All of the data required to show compliance with the appropriate regulations;

(b) If the equipment is assembled using modular components that, by themselves, are subject to authorization under a Declaration of Conformity and/or a grant of certification, and the assembled product is also subject to authorization under a Declaration of Conformity but, in accordance with the applicable regulations, does not require additional testing, the assembler shall maintain the following records in order to show the basis on which compliance with the standards was determined:

(1) A listing of all of the components used in the assembly;

(2) Copies of the compliance information, as described in § 2.1077 for all of the modular components used in the assembly;

(3) A listing of the FCC Identifier numbers for all of the components used in the assembly that are authorized under a grant of certification;

(4) A listing of equipment modifications, if any, that were made during assembly; and

(5) A copy of any instructions included with the components that were required to be followed to ensure the assembly of a compliant product, along with a statement, signed by the assembler, that these instructions were followed during assembly. This statement shall also contain the name and signature of an official of the responsible party, as designated in § 2.909.

(c) The records listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be retained for two years after the manufacture or assembly, as appropriate, of said equipment has been permanently discontinued, or until the conclusion of an investigation or a proceeding if the responsible party is officially notified that an investigation or any other administrative proceeding involving the equipment has been instituted. Requests for the records described in this section and for sample units also are covered under the provisions of § 2.946.
