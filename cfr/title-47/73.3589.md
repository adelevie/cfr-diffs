(a) No person shall make or receive any payments in exchange for withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing a petition to deny or an informal objection. For the purposes of this section, reimbursement by an applicant of the legitimate and prudent expenses of a potential petitioner or objector incurred reasonably and directly in preparing to file a petition to deny will not be considered to be payment for refraining from filing a petition to deny or informal objection. Payments made directly to a potential petitioner or objector, or a person related to a potential petitioner or objector, to implement nonfinancial promises are prohibited unless specifically approved by the Commission.

(b) Whenever any payment is made in exchange for withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing a petition to deny or informal objection, the licensee must file with the Commission a copy of any written agreement related to the dismissal or withdrawal, and an affidavit setting forth:

(1) Certification that neither the would-be petitioner, nor any person or organization related to the would-be petitioner, has received or will receive any money or other consideration in connection with the citizens' agreement other than legitimate and prudent expenses reasonably incurred in preparing to file the petition to deny;

(2) Certification that unless such arrangement has been specifically approved by the Commission, neither the would-be petitioner, nor any person or organization related to the would-be petitioner, is or will be involved in carrying out, for a fee, any programming ascertainment, employment or other nonfinancial initiative referred to in the citizens' agreement; and

(3) The terms of any oral agreement.

(c) For purposes of this section:

(1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section shall be executed by the licensee, if an individual; a partner having personal knowledge of the facts, if a partnership; or an officer having personal knowledge of the facts, if a corporation or association.

(2) “Legitimate and prudent expenses” are those expenses reasonably incurred by a would-be petitioner in preparing to file its petition for which reimbursement is being sought.

(3) “Other consideration” consists of financial concessions, including but not limited to the transfer of assets or the provision of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that confer any type of benefit on the recipient.
