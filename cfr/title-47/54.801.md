(a) The total amount of universal service support under this subpart, excluding administrative expenses, for areas served by price cap local exchange carriers as of June 30, 2000, is targeted to be $650 million per year, if no exchanges, other than those offered for sale prior to January 1, 2000, are sold to non-price-cap local exchange carriers or purchased from non-price cap local exchange carriers by price cap local exchange carriers.

(b) In the event that all or a portion of a study area served by a price cap local exchange carrier is sold to an entity other than a price cap local exchange carrier, and the study area or portion thereof was not offered for sale prior to January 1, 2000, then the support that would otherwise be provided under this subpart, had such study area or portion thereof not been sold, will not be distributed or collected. Subsequent calculations will use the last reported data for the study area or portion thereof that was sold to determine the amount that will not be distributed or collected.

(c) In the event that a price cap local exchange carrier acquires additional exchanges, from an entity other than a price cap local exchange carrier, that acquisition should be reported to the Administrator pursuant to ยง 54.802 and included in the determination of study area support pursuant to ยง 54.806 for the areas served by the acquiring price cap LEC, beginning with the next support recalculation pursuant to ยง 54.808.

(d) In the event that a price cap local exchange carrier acquires additional exchanges from an entity that is also a price cap local exchange carrier, the acquiring price cap local exchange carrier will receive support under this subpart at the same level as the selling price cap local exchange carrier formerly received, and both carriers will adjust their line counts accordingly beginning with the next quarterly report to the Administrator. At the subsequent report to the Administrator for purposes of recalculating support as required by ยง 54.808, the acquiring and selling price cap local exchange carriers will reflect the acquired and sold lines, and will adjust the Average CMT Revenue per Line month for the affected study areas accordingly.

(e) The Administrator for the fund created by this subpart shall be the Universal Service Administrative Company.

(f) Beginning January 1, 2012, no incumbent or competitive eligible telecommunications carrier shall receive support pursuant to this subpart, nor shall any incumbent or competitive eligible telecommunications carrier be required to complete any filings pursuant to this subpart after March 31, 2012.
