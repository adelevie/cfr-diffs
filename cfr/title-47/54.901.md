(a) Interstate Common Line Support available to a rate-of-return carrier shall equal the Common Line Revenue Requirement per Study Area as calculated in accordance with part 69 of this chapter minus:

(1) The study area revenues obtained from end user common line charges at their allowable maximum as determined by §§ 69.104(n) and 69.104(o) of this chapter;

(2) The carrier common line charge revenues to be phased out pursuant to § 69.105 of this chapter;

(3) The special access surcharge pursuant to § 69.114 of this chapter;

(4) The line port costs in excess of basic analog service pursuant to § 69.130 of this chapter; and

(5) Any Long Term Support for which the carrier is eligible or, if the carrier ceased participation in the NECA common line pool after October 11, 2001, any Long Term Support for which the carrier would have been eligible if it had not ceased its participation in the pool.

(b) The per-line Interstate Common Line Support available to a competitive eligible telecommunications carrier serving lines in a study area served by a rate-of-return carrier shall be calculated by the Administrator as follows:

(1) If the rate-of-return carrier has disaggregated the support it receives in the study area pursuant to § 54.315, the Administrator shall calculate the amount of Interstate Common Line Support targeted to each disaggregation zone by the rate-of-return carrier (targeted Interstate Common Line Support). If the rate-of-return carrier has chosen not to disaggregate its support for a study area pursuant to § 54.315, then the entirety of its Interstate Common Line Support for the study area shall be considered targeted Interstate Common Line Support for purposes of performing the calculations in this section.

(2) In each disaggregation zone or undisaggregated study area, the Administrator shall calculate the Average Interstate Common Line Support by dividing the rate-of-return carrier's targeted Interstate Common Line Support by its total lines served.

(3) The Administrator shall then calculate the Interstate Common Line Support available to the competitive eligible telecommunications carrier for each line it serves for each customer class in a disaggregation zone or undisaggregated study area by the following formula:

(i) If the Average Interstate Common Line Support is greater than $2.70 multiplied by the number of residential and single-line business lines served by the rate-of-return carrier in the disaggregation zone or undisaggregated study area, then:

(A) Interstate Common Line Support per Multi-Line Business Line = (Average Interstate Common Line Support − $2.70 × residential and single-line business lines served by the rate-of-return carrier) ÷ (total lines served by the rate-of-return carrier); and

(B) Interstate Common Line Support per Residential and Single-Line Business Line = Interstate Common Line Support per Multi-Line Business Line + $2.70.

(ii) If the Average Interstate Common Line Support is less than or equal to $2.70 multiplied by residential and single-line business lines served by the rate-of-return carrier in the disaggregation zone or undisaggregated study area, but greater than $0, then:

(A) Interstate Common Line Support per Multi-Line Business Line = $0; and

(B) Interstate Common Line Support per Residential and Single-Line Business Line = Average Interstate Common Line Support ÷ residential and single line business lines served by the rate-of-return carrier.

(iii) If the Average Interstate Common Line Support is equal to $0, then the competitive eligible telecommunications carrier shall receive no Interstate Common Line Support for lines served in that disaggregation zone or undisaggregated study area.

(4) Beginning January 1, 2012, competitive eligible telecommunications carriers shall not receive Interstate Common Line Support pursuant to this subpart and will instead receive support consistent with § 54.307(e).

(c) Beginning January 1, 2012, for purposes of calculating Interstate Common Line Support, corporate operations expense allocated to the Common Line Revenue Requirement, pursuant to § 69.409 of this chapter, shall be limited to the lesser of:

(1) The actual average monthly per-loop corporate operations expense; or

(2) A monthly per-loop amount computed pursuant to § 36.621(a)(4)(iii) of this chapter.

(d) Support After December 31, 2011. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, beginning January 1, 2012, no carrier that is a rate-of-return carrier, as that term is defined in § 54.5 affiliated with a price cap local exchange carrier, as that term is defined in § 61.3(aa) of this chapter, shall receive support under this subpart.
