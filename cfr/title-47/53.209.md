(a) A Bell operating company required to operate a separate affiliate under section 272 of the Act shall obtain and pay for a Federal/State joint audit every two years conducted by an independent auditor to determine whether the Bell operating company has complied with the rules promulgated under section 272 and particularly the audit requirements listed in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) The independent audit shall determine:

(1) Whether the separate affiliate required under section 272 of the Act has:

(i) Operated independently of the Bell operating company;

(ii) Maintained books, records, and accounts in the manner prescribed by the Commission that are separate from the books, records and accounts maintained by the Bell operating company;

(iii) Officers, directors and employees that are separate from those of the Bell operating company;

(iv) Not obtained credit under any arrangement that would permit a creditor, upon default, to have recourse to the assets of the Bell operating company; and

(v) Conducted all transactions with the Bell operating company on an arm's length basis with the transactions reduced to writing and available for public inspection.

(2) Whether or not the Bell operating company has:

(i) Discriminated between the separate affiliate and any other entity in the provision or procurement of goods, services, facilities, and information, or the establishment of standards;

(ii) Accounted for all transactions with the separate affiliate in accordance with the accounting principles and rules approved by the Commission.

(3) Whether or not the Bell operating company and an affiliate subject to section 251(c) of the Act:

(i) Have fulfilled requests from unaffiliated entities for telephone exchange service and exchange access within a period no longer than the period in which it provides such telephone exchange service and exchange access to itself or its affiliates;

(ii) Have made available facilities, services, or information concerning its provision of exchange access to other providers of interLATA services on the same terms and conditions as it has to its affiliate required under section 272 that operates in the same market;

(iii) Have charged its separate affiliate under section 272, or imputed to itself (if using the access for its provision of its own services), an amount for access to its telephone exchange service and exchange access that is no less than the amount charged to any unaffiliated interexchange carriers for such service; and

(iv) Have provided any interLATA or intraLATA facilities or services to its interLATA affiliate and made available such services or facilities to all carriers at the same rates and on the same terms and conditions, and allocated the associated costs appropriately.

(c) An independent audit shall be performed on the first full year of operations of the separate affiliate required under section 272 of the Act, and biennially thereafter.

(d) The Chief, Enforcement Bureau, shall work with the regulatory agencies in the states having jurisdiction over the Bell operating company's local telephone services, to attempt to form a Federal/State joint audit team with the responsibility for overseeing the planning of the audit as specified in § 53.211 and the analysis and evaluation of the audit as specified in § 53.213. The Federal/State joint audit team may direct the independent auditor to take any actions necessary to ensure compliance with the audit requirements listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If the state regulatory agencies having jurisdiction choose not to participate in the Federal/State joint audit team, the Chief, Enforcement Bureau, shall establish an FCC audit team to oversee and direct the independent auditor to take any actions necessary to ensure compliance with the audit requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.
