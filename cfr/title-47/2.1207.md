In order to determine compliance with its regulations, Commission representatives may examine or test any radio frequency device that is imported. If such radio frequency device has already entered the U.S., the ultimate consignee or subsequent owners of that device must, upon request, made within one year of the date of entry, make that device available for examination or testing by the Commission.
