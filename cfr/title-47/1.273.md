At the conclusion of the hearing or within 20 days thereafter, all parties to the proceeding may agree to waive an initial or recommended decision, and may request that the Commission issue a final decision or order in the case. If the Commission has directed that its review function in the case be performed by a commissioner, a panel of commissioners, the request shall be directed to the appropriate review authority. The Commission or such review authority may in its discretion grant the request, in whole or in part, if such action will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.
