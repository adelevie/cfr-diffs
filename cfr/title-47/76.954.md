(a) The Commission will conduct an initial review of a complaint to determine if it meets the minimum showing required to allow the complaint to go forward. The minimum showing shall be satisfied if the complaint is filed using the standard complaint form described in ยง 76.951 and includes all information and attachments required by that form. A complainant will not be required, as part of the minimum showing, to provide the underlying information and calculations necessary to judge the cable programming service rate in question against the Commission's rate standards.

(b) A complaint that does not meet the minimum showing requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered defective. A defective complaint will be dismissed without prejudice to filing a corrected complaint as provided by ยง 76.955. The Commission will notify the complainant by mail of the dismissal. The filing of a complaint on the applicable form, but which is otherwise defective, will toll the limitation period established by ยง 76.953.
