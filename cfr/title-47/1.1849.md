(a) Except as otherwise provided in ยง 1.1850, no qualified individual with a disability shall, because the Commission's facilities are inaccessible to, or unusable, by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Commission.

(b) Individuals shall request accessibility to the Commission's programs and facilities by contacting the Commission's Section 504 Officer. Such contact may be made in the manner indicated in the FCC Section 504 Handbook. The Commission will make every effort to provide accommodations requiring the assistance of other persons (e.g., American Sign Language interpreters, communication access realtime translation (CART) providers, transcribers, captioners, and readers) if the request is made to the Commission's Section 504 Officer a minimum of five business days in advance of the program. If such requests are made fewer than five business days prior to an event, the Commission will make every effort to secure accommodation services, although it may be less likely that the Commission will be able to secure such services.
