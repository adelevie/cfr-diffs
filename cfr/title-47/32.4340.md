(a) This account shall include the balance of income tax expense related to noncurrent items from regulated operations which have been deferred to later periods as a result of comprehensive interperiod tax allocation related to temporary differences that arise from regulated operations.

(b) This account shall be credited or debited, as appropriate, and Account 7250, Provision for Deferred Operating Income Taxes—Net, shall reflect the offset for the tax effect of revenues and expenses from regulated operations which have been included in the determination of taxable income, but which will not be included in the determination of book income or for the tax effect of revenues and expenses from regulated operations which have been included in the determination of book income prior to the inclusion in the determination of taxable income.

(c) As regulated assets or liabilities which generated the prepaid income tax or deferred income tax are reclassified from long-term or noncurrent status to current status, the appropriate deferred income tax shall be reclassified from this account to Account 4100, Net Current Deferred Operating Income Taxes.
              

(d) The classification of deferred income taxes as current or noncurrent shall follow the classification of the asset or liability that gave rise to the deferred income tax. If there is no related asset or liability, classification shall be based on the expected turnaround of the temporary difference.

(e) Subsidiary record categories shall be maintained in order that the company may separately report the amounts contained herein that are property related and those that are nonproperty related. Such subsidiary record categories shall be reported as required by part 43 of this Commission's Rules and Regulations.
