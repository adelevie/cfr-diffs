(a) Counsel may advise his client in confidence, either upon his own initiative or that of the witness, before, during, and after the conclusion of the proceeding.

(b) Counsel for the witness will be permitted to make objections on the record, and to state briefly the basis for such objections, in connection with any examination of his client.

(c) At the conclusion of the examination of his client, counsel may ask clarifying questions if in the judgment of the presiding officer such questioning is necessary or desirable in order to avoid ambiguity or incompleteness in the responses previously given.

(d) Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, counsel for the witness may not examine or cross-examine any witness, or offer documentary evidence, unless authorized by the Commission to do so.
