(vii) Participate in the AMVER system while engaged on any voyage where the vessel is navigated in the open sea for more than 24 hours. Copies of the AMVER Bulletin are available at: AMVER Maritime Relations, USCG Battery Park Building, Room 201, New York, NY 10004-1499. Phone 212-668-7764; Fax 212-668-7684.

(4) Vessels operated more than 200 nautical miles from the nearest land must:

(i) Be equipped with two VHF-DSC radiotelephone installations meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that VHF radiotelephone installations without DSC capability are permitted until one year after the Coast Guard notifies the Commission that shore-based sea area A1 coverage is established;

(ii) Be equipped with an MF-DSC radiotelephone transmitter and receiver meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that a MF radiotelephone installation without DSC capability is permitted until one year after the Coast Guard notifies the Commission that shore-based sea area A2 coverage is established;

(iii) Be equipped with either:

(A) A DSC-capable independent single sideband radiotelephone meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section and that is capable of operating on all distress and safety frequencies in the medium frequency and high frequency bands listed in § 80.369(a) and (b), on all of the ship-to-shore calling frequencies in the high frequency bands listed in § 80.369(d), and on at least four of the automated mutual-assistance vessel rescue (AMVER) system HF duplex channels; or

(B) If operated in an area within the coverage of an INMARSAT maritime mobile geostationary satellite in which continuous alerting is available, an INMARSAT B, C, M, or Fleet F77 ship earth station, or an INMARSAT A ship earth station if installed prior to February 12, 2004.

(iv) Be equipped with a reserve power supply meeting the requirements of §§ 80.917(b), 80.919 and 80.921, and capable of powering the single sideband radiotelephone or the ship earth station (including associated peripheral equipment) required by paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, including the navigation receiver referred to in § 80.905(a)(5);

(v) Be equipped with a NAVTEX receiver conforming to the following performance standards: IMO Resolution A.525(13), as revised by IMO Resolution MSC.148(77) and ITU-R M.540-2 (all incorporated by reference, see § 80.7);

(vi) Be equipped with a Category I 406-406.1 MHz satellite emergency position-indicating radiobeacon (EPIRB) meeting the requirements of § 80.1061;

(viii) Participate in the AMVER system while engaged on any voyage where the vessel is navigated in the open sea for more than 24 hours. Copies of the AMVER Bulletin are available at: AMVER Maritime Relations, USCG Battery Park Building, Room 201, New York, NY 10004-1499. Phone 212-668-7764; Fax 212-668-7684.

(5) Vessels must comply with the requirements for a navigation receiver or manual updating of position information contained in § 80.1085(c).

(b) For a vessel that is navigated within the communication range of a VHF public coast station or U.S. Coast Guard station, but beyond the 20-nautical mile limitation specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an exemption from the band 1605 to 2850 kHz installation requirements may be granted if the vessel is equipped with a VHF transmitter and receiver. An application for exemption must include a chart showing the route of the voyage or the area of operation of the vessel, and the receiving service area of the VHF public coast or U.S. Coast Guard station. The coverage area of the U.S. Coast Guard station must be based on written information from the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard, a copy of which must be furnished with the application. The coverage area of a public coast station must be computed by the method specified in subpart P of this part.

(c) The radiotelephone installation must be installed to insure safe operation of the equipment and to facilitate repair. It must be protected against the vibration, moisture, temperature, and excessive currents and voltages.

(d) A VHF-DSC radiotelephone installation or a remote unit must be located at each steering station except those auxiliary steering stations which are used only during brief periods for docking or for close-in maneuvering. A single portable VHF-DSC radiotelephone set meets the requirements of this paragraph if adequate permanent mounting arrangements with suitable power provision and antenna feed are installed at each operator steering station. Additionally, for vessels of more than 100 gross tons, the radiotelephone installation must be located at the level of the main wheelhouse or at least one deck above the vessel's main deck.
