(a) An application for license by the lawful holder of a construction permit will be granted without hearing where the Commission, upon examination of such application, finds that all the terms, conditions, and obligations set forth in the application and permit have been fully met, and that no cause or circumstance arising or first coming to the knowledge of the Commission since the granting of the permit would, in the judgment of the Commission, make the operation of such station against the public interest.

(b) In the event the Commission is unable to make the findings in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will designate the application for hearing upon specified issues.
