(a) Measurement sites. Radiated emission tests for peak effective radiated power (PERP), spurious emissions and power in the test mode are to be performed on an open field test site as shown in Figure 1. The site is to be located on level ground with an obstruction-free, 60 m by 52 m, elliptical area. The site is to be equipped with an antenna mast capable of adjustment from 1 to 4 m. The center of a metal ground plane at least one wavelength in diameter at 121.5 MHz (2.47 m) is to be located 30 m from the receiving antenna. The ground plane is to have provisions for mounting removable quarter-wave verticle elements to produce a monopole antenna at both 121.5 and 243 MHz with the VSWR of less than 1.5.
                                    

(b) Temperature. Except as otherwise noted, the ambient temperature during testing is to be within the range of 4 to 35 °C (40 to 95 °F).
