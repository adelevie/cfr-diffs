Cross-complaints seeking any relief within the jurisdiction of the Commission against any party (complainant or defendant) to that proceeding are expressly prohibited. Any claim that might otherwise meet the requirements of a cross-complaint may be filed as a separate complaint in accordance with §§ 14.38 through 14.40 of this subpart. For purposes of this subpart, the term “cross-complaint” shall include counterclaims.
