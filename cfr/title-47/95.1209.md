(a) Except for the purposes of testing and for demonstrations to health care professionals, MedRadio programmer/control transmitters may transmit only non-voice data containing operational, diagnostic and therapeutic information associated with a medical implant device or medical body-worn device that has been implanted or placed on the person by or under the direction of a duly authorized health care professional.
                                    

(b) Except as provided in § 95.628(b) no MedRadio implant or body-worn transmitter shall transmit except in response to a transmission from a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter or in response to a non-radio frequency actuation signal generated by a device external to the body with respect to which the MedRadio implant or body-worn transmitter is used.

(c) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters may be interconnected with other telecommunications systems including the public switched telephone network.

(d) For the purpose of facilitating MedRadio system operation during a MedRadio communications session, as defined in § 95.628, MedRadio transmitters may transmit in accordance with the provisions of § 95.628(a) for no more than 5 seconds without the communications of data; MedRadio transmitters may transmit in accordance with the provisions of § 95.628(b)(2) and (b)(3) for no more than 3.6 seconds in total within a one hour time period; and MedRadio transmitters may transmit in accordance with the provisions of § 95.628(b)(4) for no more than 360 milliseconds in total within a one hour time period.

(e) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters may not be used to relay information to a receiver that is not included with a medical implant or medical body-worn device.
