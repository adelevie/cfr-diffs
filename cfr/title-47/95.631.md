(a) A GMRS transmitter must transmit only emission types A1D, F1D, G1D, H1D, J1D, R1D, A3E, F3E, G3E, H3E, J3E or R3E. A non-voice emission is limited to selective calling or tone-operated squelch tones to establish or continue voice communications. See ยง 95.181 (g) and (h).

(b) An R/C transmitter may transmit any appropriate non-voice emission which meets the emission limitations of ยง 95.633.

(c) A CB transmitter may transmit only emission types A1D, H1D, J1D, R1D, A3E, H3E, J3E, R3E. A non-voice emission is limited to selective calling or tone-operated squelch tones to establish or continue voice communications. See ยง 95.412 (b) and (c).

(d) An FRS unit may transmit only emission type F3E or F2D. A non-voice emission is limited to selective calling or tone-operated squelch tones to establish or continue voice communications, digital data transmission of location information or text messaging.
                                    

(e) No GMRS or CB transmitter shall employ a digital modulation or emission.

(f) No GMRS, CB or R/C transmitter shall transmit non-voice data.

(g) An LPRS station may transmit any emission type appropriate for communications in this service. Two-way voice communications, however, are prohibited.

(h) A MedRadio station may transmit any emission type appropriate for communications in this service. Voice communications, however, are prohibited.

(i) A WMTS station may transmit any emission type appropriate for communications in this service, except for video and voice. Waveforms such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) are not considered video.

(j) A MURS transmitter must transmit only emission types A1D, A2B, A2D, A3E, F2B, F1D, F2D, F3E, G3E. Emission types A3E, F3E and G3E include selective calling or tone-operated squelch tones to establish or continue voice communications. MURS transmitters are prohibited from transmitting in the continuous carrier mode.

(k) DSRCS-OBUs are governed under subpart L of this part.
