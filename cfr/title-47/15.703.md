(a) Available channel. A television channel which is not being used by an authorized user at or near the same geographic location as the TVBD and is acceptable for use by an unlicensed device under the provisions of ยง 15.709. A TVBD determines television channel availability either from the TV bands database or spectrum sensing.

(b) Client device. A TVBD operating in client mode.

(c) Client mode. An operating mode in which the transmissions of the TVBD, including frequencies of operation, are under control of the master device. A device in client mode is not able to initiate a network.

(d) Fixed device. A TVBD that transmits and/or receives radiocommunication signals at a specified fixed location. Fixed TVBDs may operate as part of a system, transmitting to one or more fixed TVBDs or to personal/portable TVBDs.

(e) Geo-location. The capability of a TVBD to determine its geographic coordinates within a specified level of accuracy.

(f) Master device. A TVBD operating in master mode.

(g) Master mode. An operating mode in which the TVBD has the capability to transmit without receiving an enabling signal. The TVBD is able to select a channel itself based on a list provided by the database and initiate a network by sending enabling signals to other devices. A network always has at least one device operating in master mode.

(h) Mode I operation. Operation of a personal/portable TVBD operating only on the available channel identified by either the fixed TVBD or Mode II TVBD that enables its operation. Mode I operation does not require use of a geo-location capability or access to the TV bands database and requires operation in client mode.

(i) Mode II operation. Operation of a personal/portable TVBD whereby the device determines the available channels at its location using its own geo-location and TV bands database access capabilities. Devices operating in Mode II may function as master devices.

(j) Network initiation. The process by which a fixed or Mode II TVBD sends control signals to another similar device or to a client device(s) and allows them to begin transmissions.
              

(k) Operating channel. An available channel used by a TVBD for transmission and/or reception.

(l) Personal/portable device. A TVBD that transmits and/or receives radiocommunication signals while in motion or at unspecified locations that may change.

(m) Receive site. The location where the signal of a full service station is received for rebroadcast by a television translator or low power TV, including Class A TV, station.

(n) Spectrum sensing. A process whereby a TVBD monitors a television channel to detect whether the channel is occupied by a radio signal.

(o) Television band device (TVBD). Intentional radiators operating on available channels in the broadcast television frequency bands at 54-60 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz, 470-608 MHz and 614-698 MHz.

(p) TV bands database. A database of authorized services in the TV frequency bands that is used to determine the available channels at a given location for use by TVBDs.
