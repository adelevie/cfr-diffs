(a) A grant of equipment authorization is valid only when the FCC Identifier is permanently affixed on the device and remains effective until revoked or withdrawn, rescinded, surrendered, or a termination date is otherwise established by the Commission.

(b) A grant of an equipment authorization signifies that the Commission has determined that the equipment has been shown to be capable of compliance with the applicable technical standards if no unauthorized change is made in the equipment and if the equipment is properly maintained and operated. The issuance of a grant of equipment authorization shall not be construed as a finding by the Commission with respect to matters not encompassed by the Commission's rules, especially with respect to compliance with 18 U.S.C. 2512.

(c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use or make reference to an equipment authorization in a deceptive or misleading manner or convey the impression that such equipment authorization reflects more than a Commission determination that the device or product has been shown to be capable of compliance with the applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.
