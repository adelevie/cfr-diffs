All applicants for DEMS frequencies in the 10.6 GHz band must submit as part of the original application a detailed plan indicating how the bandwidth requested will be utilized. In particular the application must contain detailed descriptions of the modulation method, the channel time sharing method, any error detecting and/or correcting codes, any spatial frequency reuse system and the total data throughput capacity in each of the links in the system. Further, the application must include a separate analysis of the spectral efficiency including both information bits per unit bandwidth and the total bits per unit bandwidth.
