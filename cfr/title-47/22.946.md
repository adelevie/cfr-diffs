(a) Commencement of service. New cellular systems must be at least partially constructed and begin providing cellular service to subscribers within the service commencement periods specified in Table H-1 of this section. Service commencement periods begin on the date of grant of the initial authorization, and are not extended by the grant of subsequent authorizations for the cellular system (such as for major modifications). The licensee must notify the FCC (FCC Form 601) after the requirements of this section are met (see ยง 1.946 of this chapter).

(b) To satisfy this requirement, a cellular system must be interconnected with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and must be providing service to mobile stations operated by its subscribers and roamers. A cellular system is considered to be providing service only if mobile stations can originate telephone calls to and receive telephone calls from wireline telephones through the PSTN.

(c) Construction period for specific facilities. The construction period applicable to specific new or modified cellular facilities for which a separate authorization is granted is one year, beginning on the date the authorization is granted.
