(a) To minimize or avoid harmful interference to Federal Government Satellite Earth Stations located in the Denver, Colorado and Washington, DC areas, any application for a new station license to provide MVPD operations in the 17.7-17.8 GHz band or to operate in the 17.8-19.7 GHz band for any service, or for modification of an existing station license in these bands which would change the frequency, power, emission, modulation, polarization, antenna height or directivity, or location of such a station, must be coordinated with the Federal Government by the Commission before an authorization will be issued, if the station or proposed station is located in whole or in part within any of the areas defined by the following rectangles or circles:

41°30′00″ N. Lat. on the north

103°10′00″ W. Long. on the east

38°30′00″ N. Lat. on the south

106°30′00″ W. Long. on the west

38°30′00″ N. Lat. on the north

105°00′00″ W. Long. on the east

37°30′00″ N. Lat. on the south

105°50′00″ W. Long. on the west

40°08′00″ N. Lat. on the north

107°00′00″ W. Long. on the east

39°56′00″ N. Lat. on the south

107°15′00″ W. Long. on the west

38°40′00″ N. Lat. on the north

78°50′00″ W. Long. on the east

38°10′00″ N. Lat. on the south

79°20′00″ W. Long. on the west

or

(b) Within a radius of 178 km of 38°48′00″ N. Lat./76°52′00″ W. Long.

(c) In addition, no application seeking authority for MVPD operations in the 17.7-17.8 GHz band or to operate in the 17.8-19.7 GHz band for any service will be accepted for filing if the proposed station is located within 20 km of the following coordinates:
                        


                          Note to § 74.32: The coordinates cited in this section are specified in terms of the “North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83)” with an accuracy of ±30 meters with respect to the “National Spacial Reference System”.
