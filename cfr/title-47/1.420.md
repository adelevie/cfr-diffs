(a) Comments filed in proceedings for amendment of the FM Table of Allotments (§ 73.202 of this chapter) or the Television Table of Allotments (§ 73.606 of this chapter) which are initiated on a petition for rule making shall be served on petitioner by the person who files the comments.

(g) The Commission may modify the license or permit of a UHF TV station to a VHF channel in the same community in the course of the rule making proceeding to amend § 73.606(b), or it may modify the license or permit of an FM station to another class of channel through notice and comment procedures, if any of the following conditions are met:
