The applicant for a station in the Experimental Radio Services accepts the license with the express understanding: (a) that the authority to use the frequency or frequencies assigned is granted upon an experimental basis only and does not confer any right to conduct an activity of a continuing nature; and

(b) that said grant is subject to change or cancellation by the Commission at any time without hearing if in its discretion the need for such action arises. However, a petition for reconsideration or application for review may be filed to such Commission action.
