(a) Applications for new cable television relay stations, other than fixed stations, will not be accepted unless the equipment specified therein has been certificated. In the case of fixed stations, the equipment must be authorized under the verification procedure for use pursuant to the provisions of this subpart. Transmitters designed for use in the 31.0 to 31.3 GHz band shall be authorized under the verification procedure.

(1) All transmitters first licensed or marketed shall comply with technical standards of this subpart. This paragraph (b)(1) of this section is effective October 1, 1981.

(2) Neither certification nor verification is required for the following transmitters:

(i) Those which have an output power not greater than 250 mW and which are used in a CARS pickup station operating in the 12.7-13.2 GHz band; and

(ii) Those used under a developmental authorization.

(b) Cable television relay station transmitting equipment authorized to be used pursuant to an application accepted for filing prior to October 1, 1981, may continue to be used, provided, that if operation of such equipment causes harmful interference due to its failure to comply with the technical standards set forth in this subpart the Commission may, at its discretion, require the licensee to take such corrective action as is necessary to eliminate the interference.

(c) The installation of a CARS station shall be made by or under the immediate supervision of a qualified engineer. Any tests or adjustments requiring the radiation of signals and which could result in improper operation shall be conducted by or under the immediate supervision of a person with required knowledge and skill to perform such tasks.

(d) Simple repairs such as the replacement of tubes, fuses, or other plug-in components which require no particular skill may be made by an unskilled person. Repairs requiring replacement of attached components or the adjustment of critical circuits or corroborative measurements shall be made only by a person with required knowledge and skill to perform such tasks.
