Mutually exclusive applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, including those that are mutually exclusive with applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, are processed in accordance with § 22.131 and with this section.
              

(a) Applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service may be mutually exclusive with applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service if they seek authorization to operate facilities on the same channel in the same area, or the technical proposals are otherwise in conflict. See § 22.567.

(b) A modification application in either service filed on the earliest filing date may cause all later-filed mutually exclusive applications of any type in either service to be “cut off” (excluded from a same-day filing group) and dismissed, pursuant to § 22.131(c)(3)(ii) and § 22.131(c)(4).
