(a) In state proceedings, a state commission shall establish rates for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic that are structured consistently with the manner that carriers incur those costs, and consistently with the principles in §§ 51.507 and 51.509.

(b) The rate of a carrier providing transmission facilities dedicated to the transmission of traffic between two carriers' networks shall recover only the costs of the proportion of that trunk capacity used by an interconnecting carrier to send traffic that will terminate on the providing carrier's network. Such proportions may be measured during peak periods.
