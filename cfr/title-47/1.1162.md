No regulatory fee established in §§ 1.1152 through 1.1156, unless otherwise qualified herein, shall be required for: (a) Applicants, permittees or licensees in the Amateur Radio Service, except that any person requesting a vanity call-sign shall be subject to the payment of a regulatory fee, as prescribed in § 1.1152.

(b) Applicants, permittees, or licensees who qualify as government entities. For purposes of this exemption, a government entity is defined as any state, possession, city, county, town, village, municipal corporation, or similar political organization or subpart thereof controlled by publicly elected or duly appointed public officials exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective communities or programs.

(c) Applicants and permittees who qualify as nonprofit entities. For purposes of this exemption, a nonprofit entity is defined as: an organization duly qualified as a nonprofit, tax exempt entity under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501; or an entity with current certification as a nonprofit corporation or other nonprofit entity by state or other governmental authority.

(1) Any permittee, licensee or other entity subject to a regulatory fee and claiming an exemption from a regulatory fee based upon its status as a nonprofit entity, as described above, shall file with the Secretary of the Commission (Attn: Managing Director) written documentation establishing the basis for its exemption within 60 days of its coming under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission or at the time its fee payment would otherwise be due, whichever is sooner, or at such other time as required by the Managing Director. Acceptable documentation may include Internal Revenue Service determination letters, state or government certifications or other documentation that non-profit status has been approved by a state or other governmental authority. Applicants, permittees and licensees are required to file documentation of their nonprofit status only once, except upon request of the Managing Director.
                                    

(2) Within sixty (60) days of a change in nonprofit status, a licensee or permittee previously claiming a 501(C) exemption is required to file with the Secretary of the Commission (Attn: Managing Director) written notice of such change in its nonprofit status or ownership. Additionally, for-profit purchasers or assignees of a license, station or facility previously licensed or operated by a non-profit entity not subject to regulatory fees must notify the Secretary of the Commission (Attn: Managing Director) of such purchase or reassignment within 60 days of the effective date of the purchase or assignment.

(d) Applicants, permittees or licensees in the Special Emergency Radio and Public Safety Radio services.

(f) Applicants, permittees, or licensees qualifying under paragraph (e) of this section requesting Commission authorization in any other mass media radio service (except the international broadcast (HF) service), wireless radio service, common carrier radio service, or international radio service requiring payment of a regulatory fee, if the service is used in conjunction with their NCE broadcast station on an NCE basis.

(g) Other applicants, permittees or licensees providing, or proposing to provide, a NCE or instructional service, but not qualifying under paragraph (e) of this section, may be exempt from regulatory fees, or be entitled to a refund, in the following circumstances:

(1) The applicant, permittee or licensee is an organization that, like the Public Broadcasting Service or National Public Radio, receives funding directly or indirectly through the Public Broadcasting Fund, 47 U.S.C. 396(k), distributed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where the authorization requested will be used in conjunction with the organization on an NCE basis;

(2) An applicant, permittee or licensee of a translator or low power television station operating or proposing to operate an NCE service who, after grant, provides proof that it has received funding for the construction of the station through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) or other showings as required by the Commission; or

(3) An applicant, permittee, or licensee provided a fee refund under § 1.1160 and operating as an NCE station, is exempt from fees for broadcast auxiliary stations (subparts D, E, F, and G of part 74 of this chapter) or stations in the wireless radio, common carrier, or international services where such authorization is to be used in conjunction with the NCE translator or low power station.

(h) An applicant, permittee or licensee that is the licensee in the Educational Broadband Service (EBS) (formerly, Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS)) (parts 27 and 74, e.g., §§ 27.1200, et seq., and 74.832(b), of this chapter) is exempt from regulatory fees where the authorization requested will be used by the applicant in conjunction with the provision of the EBS.

(i) Applications filed in the wireless radio service for the sole purpose of modifying an existing authorization (or a pending application for authorization). However, if the applicant also requests a renewal or reinstatement of its license or other authorization for which the submission of a regulatory fee is required, the appropriate regulatory fee for such additional request must accompany the application.
