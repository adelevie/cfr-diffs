(a) The term Universal Service Fund in this subpart refers only to the support for loop-related costs included in § 36.621. The term Universal Service in part 54 of this chapter refers to the comprehensive discussion of the Commission's rules implementing section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 254, which addresses universal service support for rural, insular, and high cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and heath care providers. The expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall be added to interstate expenses and deducted from state expenses after expenses and taxes have been apportioned pursuant to subpart D of this part. Beginning January 1, 1998, the expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart will be administered and funded through the new universal service system discussed in part 54 of this chapter. Effective January 1, 2012, this subpart will only apply to incumbent local exchange carriers that are rate-of-return carriers not affiliated, as “affiliated companies” are defined in § 32.9000 of this chapter, with price cap local exchange carriers. Rate-of-return carriers and price cap local exchange carriers are defined pursuant to § 54.5 and § 61.3(aa) of this chapter, respectively.

(b) The expense adjustment will be computed on the basis of data for a preceding calendar year which may be updated at the option of the carrier pursuant to § 36.612(a).
