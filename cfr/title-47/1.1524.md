Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and Bureau counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is served or an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the Administrative Law Judge determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.
