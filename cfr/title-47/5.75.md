An application for a station embracing widely divergent and unrelated experimentations will normally require a separate license for each experiment. However, if the experiments are related or conducted by the same manufacturer, an applicant may apply for a blanket license encompassing the entire experimental program. If a blanket license is granted, licensees will be required to notify the Commission of the specific details of each individual experiment, including location, number of base and mobile units, power, emission designator, and any other pertinent technical information not specified by the blanket license.
