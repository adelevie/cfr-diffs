(a) Where the FCC has denied an application for a new station or for any modification of services or facilities, or dismissed such application with prejudice, no like application involving service of the same kind for substantially the same area by substantially the same applicant, or his successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of the original parties in interest, may be filed within 12 months from the effective date of the FCC's action. However, applicants whose applications have been denied in a comparative hearing may apply immediately for another available facility.

(b) Where an appeal has been taken from the action of the FCC in denying a particular application, another application for the same class of broadcast station and for the same area, in whole or in part, filed by the same applicant, or his successor or assignee, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of the original parties in interest, will not be considered until final disposition of such appeal.
