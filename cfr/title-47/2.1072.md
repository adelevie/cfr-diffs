(a) The Declaration of Conformity signifies that the responsible party, as defined in ยง 2.909, has determined that the equipment has been shown to comply with the applicable technical standards if no unauthorized change is made in the equipment and if the equipment is properly maintained and operated. Compliance with these standards shall not be construed to be a finding by the responsible party with respect to matters not encompassed by the Commission's rules.

(b) A Declaration of Conformity by the responsible party is effective until a termination date is otherwise established by the Commission.

(c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use or make reference to a Declaration of Conformity in a deceptive or misleading manner or convey the impression that such a Declaration of Conformity reflects more than a determination by the responsible party that the device or product has been shown to be capable of complying with the applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.
