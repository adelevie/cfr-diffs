The Commission maintains several offices and receipt locations. Applications and other filings not submitted in accordance with the addresses or locations set forth below will be returned to the applicant without processing. When an application or other filing does not involve the payment of a fee, the appropriate filing address or location is established elsewhere in the rules for the various types of submissions made to the Commission. The public should identify the correct filing location by reference to these rules. Applications or submissions requiring fees must be submitted in accordance with § 0.401(b) of the rules irrespective of the addresses that may be set out elsewhere in the rules for other submissions.

(a) General correspondence, as well as applications and filings not requiring the fees set forth at part 1, subpart G of the rules (or not claiming an exemption, waiver or deferral from the fee requirement), should be delivered to one of the following locations.

In the case of any conflict between this rule subpart and other rules establishing filing locations for submissions subject to a fee, this subpart shall govern.
                                    

(1) Applications and filings submitted by mail shall be addressed to the U.S. Bank in St. Louis, Missouri.

It will also establish special post office boxes to receive responses to special filings such as applications filed in response to “filing windows” established by the Commission. The address for the submission of filings will be established in the Public Notice announcing the filing dates. In all other cases, applications and filings submitted by mail should be sent to the addresses listed in the appropriate fee rules.
                                    

(2) Applications and other filings may also be hand carried, in person or by courier, to the U.S. Bank, Government Lockbox, 1005 Convention Plaza, St. Louis, Missouri. All applications and filings delivered in this manner must be in an envelope clearly marked for the “Federal Communications Commission,” and identified with the appropriate Post Office Box address as set out in the fee schedule (§§ 1.1102 through 1.1109 of this chapter). Applications should be enclosed in a separate envelope for each Post Office Box. Hand-carried or couriered applications and filings may be delivered at any time on any day. Applications or filings received by the bank before midnight on any Commission business day will be treated as having been filed on that day. Materials received by the bank after midnight, Monday through Friday, or on weekends or holidays, will be treated as having been filed on the next Commission business day.

(3) Alternatively, applications and other filings may be sent electronically via the Universal Licensing System (ULS) or the Cable Operations and Licensing System (COALS) as appropriate for use of those systems.
