If material and relevant matter offered in evidence is embraced in a document containing other matter not material or relevant, and not intended to be put in evidence, such document will not be received, but the party offering the same shall present to other counsel, and to the presiding officer, the original document, together with true copies of such material and relevant matter taken therefrom, as it is desired to introduce. Upon presentation of such matter, material and relevant, in proper form, it may be received in evidence, and become a part of the record. Other counsel will be afforded an opportunity to introduce in evidence, in like manner, other portions of such document if found to be material and relevant.
