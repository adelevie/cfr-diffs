(a) When distress traffic has ceased, or when complete silence is no longer necessary on a frequency which has been used for distress traffic, the station which has controlled this traffic must transmit on that frequency a message addressed “to all stations” indicating that normal working may be resumed.

(1) In radiotelegraphy, this message consists of:

(i) The distress signal SOS;
                

(ii) The call “to all stations” (CQ), sent three times;

(iii) The word DE;

(iv) The call sign of the station sending the message;

(v) The time of handing in the message;

(vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in distress;

(vii) The service abbreviation QUM.

(2) In radiotelephony, this message consists of:

(i) The distress signal MAYDAY;

(ii) The call “Hello all stations”, spoken three times;

(iii) The words THIS IS;

(iv) The call sign or other identification of the station sending the message;

(v) The time of handing in of the message;

(vi) The name and call sign of the mobile station which was in distress;

(vii) The words SEELONCE FEENEE OR PRU-DONCE.

(b) Until they receive the foregoing message indicating that normal or limited working may be resumed, all stations which are aware of the distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, are forbidden to transmit on the frequencies on which the distress traffic is taking place.
