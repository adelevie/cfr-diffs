(a) An authorization for the development of a new service not in accordance with the provisions of the rules in this part may be granted for a limited time, but only after the Commission has made a preliminary determination with respect to the factors set forth in this paragraph, as each case may require. This procedure also applies to any application that involves use of a frequency which is not in accordance with the provisions of the rules in this part, although in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in part 2 of this chapter. (An application which involves use of a frequency which is not in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations in part 2 of this chapter should be filed in accordance with the provisions of part 5 of this chapter, Experimental Radio Services.) The factors with respect to which the Commission will make a preliminary determination before acting on an application filed under this paragraph are as follows:

(1) That the public interest, convenience or necessity warrants consideration of the establishment of the proposed service or the use of the proposed frequency;

(2) That the proposed operation appears to warrant consideration to effect a change in the provisions of the rules in this part; and/or

(3) That some operational data should be developed for consideration in any rule making proceeding which may be initiated.

(b) Applications for stations that are intended to be used in the development of a proposed service must be accompanied by a petition to amend the Commission's rules with respect to frequencies and such other items as may be necessary to provide for the regular establishment of the proposed service.
