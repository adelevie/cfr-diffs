(a) Until December 31, 2001, local exchange carriers not subject to price cap regulation shall assess an interconnection charge expressed in dollars and cents per access minute upon all interexchange carriers and upon all other persons using the telephone company switched access network.

(b) If the use made of the local exchange carrier's switched access network includes the local switch, but not local transport, the interconnection charge assessed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be computed by subtracting entrance facilities, tandem-switched transport, direct-trunked transport, and dedicated signalling transport revenues, as well as any interconnection charge revenues that the local exchange carrier anticipates will be reassigned to other, facilities-based rate elements in the future, from the part 69 transport revenue requirement, and dividing by the total interstate local switching minutes.

(c) If the use made of the local exchange carrier's switched access network includes local transport, the interconnection charge to be assessed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be computed by dividing any interconnection charge revenues that the local exchange carrier anticipates will be reassigned to other, facilities-based rate elements in the future by the total interstate local transport minutes, and adding thereto the per minute amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
