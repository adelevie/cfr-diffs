(a) The Geographic Service Area (GSA) is either:

(1) The area for incumbent site-based licensees that is bounded by a circle having a 35 mile radius and centered at the station's reference coordinates, which was the previous PSA entitled to incumbent licensees prior to January 10, 2005, and is bounded by the chord(s) drawn between intersection points of the licensee's previous 35 mile PSA and those of respective adjacent market, co-channel licensees; or:
              

(2) The BTA that is licensed to the respective BRS BTA authorization holder subject to the exclusion of overlapping, co-channel incumbent GSAs as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(b) If the license for an incumbent BRS station cancels or is forfeited, the GSA area of the incumbent station shall dissolve and the right to operate in that area automatically reverts to the GSA licensee that held the corresponding BTA.
