The emissions must be attenuated according to the following schedule.

(a) The mean power when using emissions H3E, J3E and R3E:

(1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 150 percent of the authorized bandwidth:
              

(2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 150 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 35 dB; and

(3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 plus 10log10 (mean power in watts) dB.

(b) For transmitters operating in the band 1626.5-1646.5 MHz. In any 4 kHz band the mean power of emissions shall be attenuated below the mean output power of the transmitter as follows:

(1) Where the center frequency is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 25 dB;

(2) Where the center frequency is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent up to 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 35 dB; and

(3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 plus 10log10 (mean power in watts) dB.

(c) In any 4 kHz band the peak power of spurious emissions and noise at the input to the transmit antenna must be attenuated below the peak output power of the station as follows:

(1) 125 dB at 1525.0 MHz, increasing linearly to 90 dB at 1612.5 MHz;

(2) 90 dB at 1612.5 MHz increasing linearly to 60 dB at 1624.0 MHz;

(3) 90 dB from 1624.0 MHz to 1650.0 MHz, except at frequencies near the transmitted carrier where the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, apply;

(4) 60 dB at 1650.0 MHz decreasing linearly to 90 dB at 1662.5 MHz;

(5) 90 dB at 1662.5 MHz decreasing linearly to 125 dB at 1752.5 MHz; and

(6) 125 dB outside above range, except for harmonics which must comply with (b)(3) of this section.
              

(d) The mean power of emissions from radiotelephone survival craft transmitters, 9 GHz search and rescue transponders, and radiotelegraph survival craft transmitters must be attenuated below the mean output power of the transmitter as follows:

(1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent, up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 25 dB;

(2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 30 dB.

(e) The mean power of EPIRBs operating on 121.500 MHz, 243.000 MHz and 406.0-406.1 MHz must be as follows:

(1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent, up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 25 dB;

(2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent: at least 30 dB.

(f) The mean power when using emissions other than those in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section:

(1) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 25 dB;

(2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 35 dB; and

(3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: At least 43 plus 10log10 (mean power in watts) dB.

(g) Developmental stations must conform to the standards for regular authorized stations.
