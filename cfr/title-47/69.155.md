(a) Local exchange carriers may recover a per-minute residual interconnection charge on originating access. The maximum such charge shall be the lower of:

(1) The per-minute rate that would recover the total annual residual interconnection charge revenues permitted less the portion of the residual interconnection charge allowed to be recovered under § 69.153; or

(2) The sum of the local switching, carrier common line and residual interconnection charges assessed on originating minutes on December 31, 1997, minus the local switching charges assessed on originating minutes, less the maximum amount allowed to be recovered under § 69.154(a).

(b) To the extent that paragraph (a) of this section prohibits a local exchange carrier from recovering all of the residual interconnection charge revenues permitted, the residual may be collected through a per-minute charge on terminating access.

(c)(1) No portion of the charge assessed pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section that recovers revenues that the local exchange carrier anticipates will be reassigned to other, facilities-based rate elements, including the tandem-switching rate element described in § 69.111(g), the three-part tandem switched transport rate structure described in § 69.111(a)(2), and port and multiplexer charges described in § 69.111(l), shall be assessed upon minutes utilizing the local exchange carrier's local switching facilities, but not the local exchange carrier's transport service.

(2) If a local exchange carrier cannot recover its full residual interconnection charge revenues through the PICC mechanism established in § 69.153, and will consequently cover a portion of its residual interconnection charge revenues through per-minute charges assessed pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, then the local exchange carrier must allocate its residual interconnection charge revenues subject to the exemption established in paragraph (c)(1) of this section between the PICC and the per-minute residual interconnection charge in the same proportion as other residual interconnection charge revenues are allocated between these two recovery mechanisms.
