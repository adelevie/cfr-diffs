(a) A renewal applicant involved in a renewal proceeding shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal expectancy, that is the most important factor to be considered in the proceeding as long as the applicant's past record for the relevant license period demonstrates that:

(1) The renewal applicant has provided “substantial service” pursuant to § 101.527; and

(2) The renewal applicant has substantially complied with applicable FCC rules, policies, and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

(b) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a licensee in the 24 GHz service involved in a renewal proceeding must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this showing must include:

(1) A description of how the licensee has complied with the “substantial service” requirement; and

(2) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy; and a list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this paragraph (b)(2).

(c) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a renewal applicant may claim credit for any system modification applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal application. Such credit will not be allowed if the modification application is dismissed or denied.
