(a) The transmission of a distress alert indicates that a mobile unit or person is in distress and requires immediate assistance. The distress alert is a digital selective call using a distress call format in bands used for terrestrial radio-communication or a distress message format, which is relayed through space stations.

(b) The distress alert must be sent through a satellite either with absolute priority in general communication channels or on exclusive distress and safety frequencies or, alternatively, on the distress and safety frequencies in the MF, HF, and VHF bands using digital selective calling.

(c) The distress alert must be sent only on the authority of the person responsible for the ship, aircraft or other vehicle carrying the mobile station or the mobile earth station.

(d) All stations which receive a distress alert transmitted by digital selective calling must immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering with distress traffic and must continue watch on the digital selective call distress calling channel until the call has been acknowledged to determine if a coast station acknowledges the call using digital selective calling. Additionally, the station receiving the distress alert must set watch on the associated distress traffic frequency for five minutes to determine if distress traffic takes place. The ship can acknowledge the call using voice or narrowband direct printing as appropriate on this channel to the ship or to the rescue authority.
