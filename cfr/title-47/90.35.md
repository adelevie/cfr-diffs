(1) Frequencies may be substituted for those available below 25 MHz in accordance with the provisions of ยง 90.263.

(2) Frequencies in the band 73.0-74.6 MHz may be assigned to stations authorized on or before December 1, 1961, but no new stations will be authorized in this band, nor will expansion of existing systems be permitted. (See also ยง 90.257).

(3) Frequencies in the 421-430 MHz band are available in the Detroit, Cleveland, and Buffalo areas in accordance with the rules in ยงยง 90.273 through 90.281.

(4) The following frequencies are available only in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These โBase and Mobileโ and โMobile onlyโ frequencies are available on a shared basis with the Public Safety Pool. These โMobile onlyโ frequencies may be assigned to a control station associated with a mobile relay system if it is also assigned to the associated mobile station.

(5) Low power mobile stations of 100 mw or less output power used for one-way, non-voice medical telemetry operations in hospitals or in medical convalescent centers are subject to the provisions of ยง 90.238.

(6) The frequency band 33.00-33.01 MHz may be used for developmental operations subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this part. Any type of emission other than pulsed emission may be used if the bandwidth occupied by the emission is contained within the assigned frequency band.

(7) A railroad licensee, i.e., a licensee eligible for frequencies listed in ยง 90.35(b)(3) of this section that are coordinated by the railroad coordinator (LR), may operate radio units at fixed locations and in moving railroad locomotives/cars that transmit on the frequency 24.10 GHz, both unmodulated continuous wave radio signals and modulated FM digital signals for the purpose of alerting motorists to the presence of an approaching train. Unattended and continuous operation of such transmitters will be permitted without additional authorization from the Commission, provided type accepted equipment or equipment authorized pursuant to ยงยง 90.203(b)(4) and (b)(5) of this part is used, and all other rule provisions are satisfied.

(e) Limitation on number of frequencies assignable. Normally only one frequency, or pair of frequencies in the paired frequency mode of operation, will be assigned for mobile service operations by a single applicant in a given area. The assignment of an additional frequency or pair of frequencies will be made only upon a satisfactory showing of need, except that:

(1) Additional frequencies above 25 MHz may be assigned in connection with operation of mobile repeaters in accordance with ยง 90.247 notwithstanding this limitation.

(2) Frequencies in the ranges 30.56-30.57 MHz, 35.00-35.01 MHz, 35.99-36.00 MHz, and 37.00-37.01 MHz are available for developmental operation by applicants in this service subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this part, notwithstanding this limitation.

(4) Authorizations for multiple frequencies for geophysical operations will be granted on the frequencies governed by the limitations in paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. However, each geophysical exploration party may use a maximum of four frequencies at any one time.

(5) Authorization for more than one mobile frequency in the band 72-76 MHz will be issued notwithstanding this limitation.

(7) Frequencies in the 457 and 467 MHz bands may be assigned collectively as provided by paragraph (c)(60) of this section notwithstanding this limitation.

(f) Limitation on itinerant operation. Base or mobile stations being utilized in itinerant operation will be authorized only on base or mobile frequencies designated for itinerant operation under paragraphs (c)(10) or (c)(17) of this section, or on other frequencies not designated for permanent use.

(g) The frequencies 9-490 kHz are used to operate electric utility Power Line Carrier (PLC) systems on power transmission lines for communications essential to the reliability and security of electric service to the public, in accordance with part 15 of this chapter. Any electric utility that generates, transmits, or distributes electrical energy for use by the general public or by the members of a cooperative organization may operate PLC systems and shall supply to a Federal Communications Commission/National Telecommunications and Information Administration recognized industry-operated entity, information on all existing, changes to existing, and proposed systems for inclusion in a data base. Such information shall include the frequency, power, location of transmitter(s), location of receivers and other technical and operational parameters, which would characterize the system's potential both to interfere with authorized radio users, and to receive harmful interference from these users. In an agreed upon format, the industry-operated entity shall inform the FCC and the NTIA of these system characteristics prior to implementation of any proposed PLC system and shall provide monthly or periodic lists with supplements of PLC systems. The FCC and NTIA will supply appropriate application and licensing information to the notification activity regarding authorized radio stations operating in the band. PLC systems in this band operate on a non-interference basis to radio systems assigned frequencies by the NTIA or licensed by the FCC and are not protected from interference due to these radio operations.
