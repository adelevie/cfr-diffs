Effective July 1, 2001, for purposes of determining non-rural carrier interim hold-harmless support, pursuant to § 54.311 of this chapter, the annual amount of the total nationwide loop cost expense adjustment calculated pursuant to this subpart F shall not exceed the amount of the total loop cost expense adjustment for the immediately preceding calendar year, increased by a rate equal to the rate of increase in the total number of working loops during the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing. The total loop cost expense adjustment shall consist of the loop cost expense adjustments, including amounts calculated pursuant to §§ 36.612(a) and 36.631. The rate of increase in total working loops shall be based upon the difference between the number of total working loops on December 31 of the calendar year preceding the July 31st filing and the number of total working loops on December 31 of the second calendar year preceding that filing, both determined by the company's submissions pursuant to § 36.611. Non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers and eligible telecommunications carriers serving lines in the service area of non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers shall only receive support pursuant to this subpart F to the extent that they qualify pursuant to § 54.311 of this chapter for interim hold-harmless support. Support amounts calculated pursuant to this subpart F but not received due to the phase down of interim hold-harmless support or the receipt of forward-looking support pursuant to § 54.311 of this chapter shall not be redistributed to other carriers.
