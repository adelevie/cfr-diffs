(a) The frequency tolerance requirements applicable to transmitters in the maritime services are shown in the following table. Tolerances are given as parts in 106 unless shown in Hz.

(b) When pulse modulation is used in land and ship radar stations operating in the bands above 2.4 GHz the frequency at which maximum emission occurs must be within the authorized bandwidth and must not be closer than 1.5/T MHz to the upper and lower limits of the authorized bandwidth where “T” is the pulse duration in microseconds. In the band 14.00-14.05 GHz the center frequency must not vary more than 10 MHz from 14.025 GHz.

(c) For stations in the maritime radiodetermination service, other than ship radar stations, the authorized frequency tolerance will be specified on the license when it is not specified in this part.
