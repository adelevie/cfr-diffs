The document should be clearly marked “copy” and should be the top document in the package. The copy will be date stamped immediately and provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the receipt document.
