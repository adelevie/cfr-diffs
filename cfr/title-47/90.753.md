(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), and (c) of this section, a Phase I non nationwide licensee may modify its authorization to relocate its authorized base station up to one-half the distance over 120 km toward any co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station, to a maximum distance of 8 km.

(b) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee with an authorized base station located outside a Designated Filing Area (DFA) (see Public Notice, DA 86-173, 52 FR 1302 (January 12, 1987)) may modify its authorization to relocate its authorized base station up to one-half the distance over 120 km toward any co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station, to a maximum distance of 25 km, so long as the base station is relocated no more than 8 km inside of any DFA (i.e., no more than 8 km from the nearest DFA boundary line).

(c) A Phase I non-nationwide licensee that has been granted Special Temporary Authority (STA) to operate at an alternative base station location may modify its authorization to seek permanent authorization at that location, regardless of whether locating the station at the STA site is in strict conformance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the licensee certifies that such a modification is in conformance with §§ 90.723 and 90.729 and:

(1) It has constructed its base station and has placed it in operation, or commenced service, at the STA site on or before January 26, 1996; or

(2) It has taken delivery of its base station transceiver on or before January 26, 1996.

(d) The application for a Phase I non-nationwide licensee proposing a base station modification resulting in less than 120 km separation from a co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station will be accepted by the Commission only with the consent of that co-channel licensee, as evidenced in a statement submitted concurrently with the licensee's application submission on FCC Form 601.

(e) The application of a Phase I non-nationwide licensee proposing a base station modification resulting in at least a 120 km separation from each co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station but more than one-half the distance over 120 km toward any co-channel licensee's initially authorized base station will be accepted by the Commission only with the consent of that co-channel licensee, as evidenced in a statement submitted concurrently with the licensee's submission on FCC Form 601.
