(a) A covered demodulator product shall not pass, or direct to be passed, Unscreened Content to any output except:

(1) To an analog output;

(2) To an 8-VSB, 16-VSB, 64-QAM or 256-QAM modulated output, provided that the broadcast flag is retained in the both the EIT and PMT;

(3) To a digital output protected by an authorized digital output protection technology authorized for use with unscreened content, in accordance with any applicable obligations established as a part of its approval pursuant to ยง 73.9008;

(4) Where the stream containing such content has not been altered following demodulation and such covered demodulator product outputs, or directs to be output, such content to a peripheral TSP product solely within the home or other, similar local environment, using a robust method;

(5) Where such covered demodulator product outputs, or directs to be output, such content to another product and such covered demodulator product exercises sole control (such as by using a cryptographic protocol), in compliance with the demodulator robustness requirements, over the access to such content in usable form in such other product;

(6) Where such covered demodulator product outputs, or directs to be output, such content for the purpose of making a recording of such content pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, where such content is protected by the corresponding recording method; or

(7) Where such covered demodulator product is incorporated into a computer product and passes, or directs to be passed, such content to an unprotected output operating in a mode compatible with the digital visual interface (DVI) rev. 1.0 Specification as an image having the visual equivalent of no more than 350,000 pixels per frame (e.g. an image with resolution of 720ร480 pixels for a 4:3 (nonsquare pixel) aspect ratio), and 30 frames per second. Such an image may be attained by reducing resolution, such as by discarding, dithering or averaging pixels to obtain the specified value, and can be displayed using video processing techniques such as line doubling or sharpening to improve the perceived quality of the image.

(b) A covered demodulator product shall not record or cause the recording of unscreened content in digital form unless such recording is made using one of the following methods:

(1) A method that effectively and uniquely associates such recording with a single covered demodulator product (using a cryptographic protocol or other effective means) so that such recording cannot be accessed in usable form by another product except where the content of such recording is passed to another product as permitted under this subpart; or

(2) An authorized recording method authorized for use with unscreened content in accordance with any applicable obligations established as a part of its approval pursuant to ยง 73.9008 (provided that for recordings made on removable media, only authorized recording methods expressly approved pursuant to ยง 73.9008 for use in connection with removable media may be used).

(c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not impose restrictions regarding the storage of unscreened content as a transitory image.

(d) The requirements of this section shall become applicable on July 1, 2005.
