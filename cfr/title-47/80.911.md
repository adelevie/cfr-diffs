(a) The transmitter must be capable of transmission of G3E emission on 156.800 MHz, 156.300 MHz, and on the ship-to-shore working frequencies necessary to communicate with public coast stations serving the area in which the vessel is navigated.

(b) The transmitter must be adjusted so that the transmission of speech normally produces peak modulation within the limits 75 percent and 100 percent.

(c) The transmitter must be certificated to transmit between 20 watts and 25 watts, on each of the frequencies 156.300 MHz, 156.800 MHz and on ship-to-shore public correspondence channels, into 50 ohms effective resistance when operated with a primary supply voltage of 13.6 volts DC.

(d) When an individual demonstration of the capability of the transmitter is necessary the output power requirements prescribed in this paragraph must be met as follows:

(1) Measurements of primary supply voltage and transmitter output power must be made with the equipment drawing energy only from ship's battery;

(2) The primary supply voltage, measured at the power input terminals to the transmitter, and the output power of the transmitter, terminated in a matching artificial load, must be measured at the end of 10 minutes of continuous operation of the transmitter at its full power output.

(3) The primary supply voltage must not be less than 11.5 volts.

(4) The transmitter output power must be not less than 15 watts.

(5) For primary supply voltages, measured in accordance with the procedures of this paragraph, greater than 11.5 volts, but less than 12.6 volts, the required transmitter output power shall be equal to or greater than the value calculated from the formula
