(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section, the carrier frequency of each station must be maintained within these tolerances:

(b) The power shown in paragraph (a) of this section is the peak envelope power for single-sideband transmitters and the mean power for all other transmitters.

(c) For single-sideband transmitters, the tolerance is:

(1) All aeronautical stations on land—10 Hz.

(2) All aircraft stations—20 Hz.

(d) For radar transmitters, except non-pulse signal radio altimeters, the frequency at which maximum emission occurs must be within the authorized frequency band and must not be closer than 1.5/T MHz to the upper and lower limits of the authorized bandwidth, where T is the pulse duration in microseconds.

(e) The Commission may authorize tolerances other than those specified in this section upon a satisfactory showing of need.

(f) The carrier frequency tolerance of transmitters operating in the 1435-1535 MHz and 2310-2390 MHz bands manufactured before January 2, 1985, is 0.003 percent. The carrier frequency tolerance of transmitters operating in the 1435-1535 MHz and 2310-2390 MHz bands manufactured after January 1, 1985, is 0.002 percent. After January 1, 1990, the carrier frequency tolerance of all transmitters operating in the 1435-1535 MHz and 2310-2390 MHz bands is 0.002 percent.
