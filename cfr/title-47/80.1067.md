(a) Ships must have the required equipment inspected at least once every 12 months by an FCC-licensed technician holding a GMDSS Radio Maintainer's License. If the ship passes the inspection the technician will issue a Safety Certificate. Safety Certificates may be obtained from the Commission's National Call Center at 1-888-CALL FCC (1-888-225-5322) or from its field offices. The effective date of the ship Safety Certificate is the date the station is found to be in compliance or not later than one business day later. The FCC-licensed technician must use the latest FCC Information Bulletin, How to Conduct a GMDSS Inspection. Contact the FCC's National Call Center at 1-888-CALL FCC (1-888-225-5322) to request a copy.

(b) Certificates issued in accordance with the Safety Convention must be posted in a prominent and accessible place on the ship.
