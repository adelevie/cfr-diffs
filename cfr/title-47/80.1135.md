(a) The operational details of the stations transmitting maritime safety information in accordance with this section are indicated in the ITU List of Radiodetermination and Special Service Stations and the IMO Master Plan of Shore-Based Facilities.

(b) The mode and format of the transmissions mentioned in this section is in accordance with the ITU-R Recommendation M.540 as specified in § 80.1101.

(c) Maritime safety information is transmitted by means of narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy with forward error correction using the frequency 518 kHz in accordance with the international NAVTEX system (see § 80.1077).

(d) The frequency 490 kHz may be used, after full implementation of the GMDSS, for the transmission of maritime safety information by means of narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy with forward error correction (see § 80.1077).

(e) Internationally, the frequency 4209.5 kHz is used for NAVTEX-type transmissions by means of narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy with forward error correction (see § 80.1077).

(f) Maritime safety information is transmitted by means of narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy with forward error correction using the frequencies 4210 kHz, 6314 kHz, 8416.5 kHz, 12579 kHz, 16806.5 kHz, 19680.5, 22376 kHz, and 26100.5 kHz (see § 80.1077).

(g) Maritime safety information is transmitted via satellite in the maritime mobile-satellite service using the band 1530-1545 MHz (see § 80.1077).
