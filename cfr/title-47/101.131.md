(a) The equipment at the operating and transmitting positions must be so installed and protected that it is not accessible to, or capable of being operated by, persons other than those duly authorized by the licensee.

(b) In any case where the maximum modulating frequency of a transmitter is prescribed by the Commission, the transmitter must be equipped with a low-pass or band-pass modulation filter of suitable performance characteristics. In those cases where a modulation limiter is employed, the modulation filter must be installed between the transmitter stage in which limiting is effected and the modulated stage of the transmitter.

(c) Each transmitter employed in these services must be equipped with an appropriately labeled pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication at the transmitter when its control circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter. In addition, facilities must be provided at each transmitter to permit the transmitter to be turned on and off independently of any remote control circuits associated therewith.

(d) At each transmitter control point the following facilities must be installed:

(1) A carrier operated device which will provide continuous visual indication when the transmitter is radiating, or, in lieu thereof, a pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication when the transmitter control circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter; and

(2) Facilities which will permit the operator to turn transmitter carrier on and off at will.

(e) Transmitter control circuits from any control point must be so installed that grounding or shorting any line in the control circuit will not cause the transmitter to radiate: provided, however, That this provision will not be applicable to control circuits of stations which normally operate with continuous radiation or to control circuits which are under the effective operational control of responsible operating personnel 24 hours per day.
