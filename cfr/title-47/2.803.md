(a) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, no person shall sell or lease, or offer for sale or lease (including advertising for sale or lease), or import, ship, or distribute for the purpose of selling or leasing or offering for sale or lease, any radio frequency device unless:

(1) In the case of a device subject to certification, such device has been authorized by the Commission in accordance with the rules in this chapter and is properly identified and labelled as required by ยง 2.925 and other relevant sections in this chapter; or

(2) In the case of a device that is not required to have a grant of equipment authorization issued by the Commission, but which must comply with the specified technical standards prior to use, such device also complies with all applicable administrative (including verification of the equipment or authorization under a Declaration of Conformity, where required), technical, labelling and identification requirements specified in this chapter.

(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not prohibit conditional sales contracts between manufacturers and wholesalers or retailers where delivery is contingent upon compliance with the applicable equipment authorization and technical requirements, nor do they prohibit agreements between such parties to produce new products, manufactured in accordance with designated specifications.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (f) of this section, a radio frequency device may be advertised or displayed, e.g., at a trade show or exhibition, prior to equipment authorization or, for devices not subject to the equipment authorization requirements, prior to a determination of compliance with the applicable technical requirements provided that the advertising contains, and the display is accompanied by, a conspicuous notice worded as follows:
              

(1) If the product being displayed is a prototype of a product that has been properly authorized and the prototype, itself, is not authorized due to differences between the prototype and the authorized product, the following disclaimer notice may be used in lieu of the notice stated in paragraph (c) introductory text of this section:
              

(2) Except as provided elsewhere in this chapter, devices displayed under the provisions of paragraphs (c) introductory text, and (c)(1) of this section may not be activated or operated.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the offer for sale solely to business, commercial, industrial, scientific or medical users (but not an offer for sale to other parties or to end users located in a residential environment) of a radio frequency device that is in the conceptual, developmental, design or pre-production stage is permitted prior to equipment authorization or, for devices not subject to the equipment authorization requirements, prior to a determination of compliance with the applicable technical requirements provided that the prospective buyer is advised in writing at the time of the offer for sale that the equipment is subject to the FCC rules and that the equipment will comply with the appropriate rules before delivery to the buyer or to centers of distribution. If a product is marketed in compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, the product does not need to be labelled with the statement in paragraph (c) of this section.

(e)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, prior to equipment authorization or determination of compliance with the applicable technical requirements any radio frequency device may be operated, but not marketed, for the following purposes and under the following conditions:

(i) Compliance testing;

(ii) Demonstrations at a trade show provided the notice contained in paragraph (c) of this section is displayed in a conspicuous location on, or immediately adjacent to, the device;

(iii) Demonstrations at an exhibition conducted at a business, commercial, industrial, scientific, or medical location, but excluding locations in a residential environment, provided the notice contained in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate, is displayed in a conspicuous location on, or immediately adjacent to, the device;

(iv) Evaluation of product performance and determination of customer acceptability, provided such operation takes place at the manufacturer's facilities during developmental, design, or pre-production states; or

(v) Evaluation of product performance and determination of customer acceptability where customer acceptability of a radio frequency device cannot be determined at the manufacturer's facilities because of size or unique capability of the device, provided the device is operated at a business, commercial, industrial, scientific, or medical user's site, but not at a residential site, during the development, design or pre-production stages. A product operated under this provision shall be labelled, in a conspicuous location, with the notice in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) For the purpose of paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (e)(1)(v) of this section, the term manufacturer's facilities includes the facilities of the party responsible for compliance with the regulations and the manufacturer's premises, as well as the facilities of other entities working under the authorization of the responsible party in connection with the development and manufacture, but not marketing, of the equipment.

(e)(3) The provisions of paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (e)(1)(ii), (e)(1)(iii), (e)(1)(iv), and (e)(1)(v) of this section do not eliminate any requirements for station licenses for products that normally require a license to operate, as specified elsewhere in this chapter.

(i) Manufacturers should note that station licenses are not required for some products, e.g., products operating under part 15 of this chapter and certain products operating under part 95 of this chapter.

(ii) Instead of obtaining a special temporary authorization or an experimental license, a manufacturer may operate its product for demonstration or evaluation purposes under the authority of a local FCC licensed service provider. However, the licensee must grant permission to the manufacturer to operate in this manner. Further, the licensee continues to remain responsible for complying with all of the operating conditions and requirements associated with its license.

(4) Marketing, as used in this section, includes sale or lease, or offering for sale or lease, including advertising for sale or lease, or importation, shipment, or distribution for the purpose of selling or leasing or offering for sale or lease.

(5) Products operating under the provisions of this paragraph (e) shall not be recognized to have any vested or recognizable right to continued use of any frequency. Operation is subject to the conditions that no harmful interference is caused and that any interference received must be accepted. Operation shall be required to cease upon notification by a Commission representative that the device is causing harmful interference and shall not resume until the condition causing the harmful interference is corrected.

(f) For radio frequency devices subject to verification and sold solely to business, commercial, industrial, scientific, and medical users (excluding products sold to other parties or for operation in a residential environment), parties responsible for verification of the devices shall have the option of ensuring compliance with the applicable technical specifications of this chapter at each end user's location after installation, provided that the purchase or lease agreement includes a proviso that such a determination of compliance be made and is the responsibility of the party responsible for verification of the equipment. If the purchase or lease agreement contains this proviso and the responsible party has the product measured to ensure compliance at the end user's location, the product does not need to be labelled with the statement in paragraph (c) of this section.

(g) The provisions in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section apply only to devices that are designed to comply with, and to the best of the responsible party's knowledge will, upon testing, comply with all applicable requirements in this chapter. The provisions in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section do not apply to radio frequency devices that could not be authorized or legally operated under the current rules. Such devices shall not be operated, advertised, displayed, offered for sale or lease, sold or leased, or otherwise marketed absent a license issued under part 5 of this chapter or a special temporary authorization issued by the Commission.

(h) The provisions in subpart K of this part continue to apply to imported radio frequency devices.
