Each nonportable bridge-to-bridge transmitter must be equipped, at each point of control, with a carrier operated device which will provide continuous visual indication when the transmitter is supplying power to the antenna transmission line or, in lieu thereof, a pilot lamp or meter which will provide continuous visual indication when the transmitter control circuits have been placed in a condition to activate the transmitter.
