(a) For an intentional radiator, the spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest radio frequency signal generated in the device, without going below 9 kHz, up to at least the frequency shown in this paragraph:

(1) If the intentional radiator operates below 10 GHz: to the tenth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 40 GHz, whichever is lower.

(2) If the intentional radiator operates at or above 10 GHz and below 30 GHz: to the fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 100 GHz, whichever is lower.

(3) If the intentional radiator operates at or above 30 GHz: to the fifth harmonic of the highest fundamental frequency or to 200 GHz, whichever is lower, unless specified otherwise elsewhere in the rules.

(4) If the intentional radiator contains a digital device, regardless of whether this digital device controls the functions of the intentional radiator or the digital device is used for additional control or function purposes other than to enable the operation of the intentional radiator, the frequency range shall be investigated up to the range specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section or the range applicable to the digital device, as shown in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, whichever is the higher frequency range of investigation.

(b) For unintentional radiators:

(1) Except as otherwise indicated in paragraphs (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, for an unintentional radiator, including a digital device, the spectrum shall be investigated from the lowest radio frequency signal generated or used in the device, without going below the lowest frequency for which a radiated emission limit is specified, up to the frequency shown in the following table:

(2) A unintentional radiator, excluding a digital device, in which the highest frequency generated in the device, the highest frequency used in the device and the highest frequency on which the device operates or tunes are less than 30 MHz and which, in accordance with § 15.109, is required to comply with standards on the level of radiated emissions within the frequency range 9 kHz to 30 MHz, such as a CB receiver or a device designed to conduct its radio frequency emissions via connecting wires or cables, e.g., a carrier current system not intended to radiate, shall be investigated from the lowest radio frequency generated or used in the device, without going below 9 kHz (25 MHz for CB receivers), up to the frequency shown in the following table. If the unintentional radiator contains a digital device, the upper frequency to be investigated shall be that shown in the table below or in the table in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, as based on both the highest frequency generated and the highest frequency used in the digital device, whichever range is higher.
                                    

(3) Except for a CB receiver, a receiver employing superheterodyne techniques shall be investigated from 30 MHz up to at least the second harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the device. If such receiver is controlled by a digital device, the frequency range shall be investigated up to the higher of the second harmonic of the highest local oscillator frequency generated in the device or the upper frequency of the measurement range specified for the digital device in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(c) The above specified frequency ranges of measurements apply to the measurement of radiated emissions and, in the case of receivers, the measurement to demonstrate compliance with the antenna conduction limits specified in § 15.111. The frequency range of measurements for AC power line conducted limits is specified in §§ 15.107 and 15.207 and applies to all equipment subject to those regulations. In some cases, depending on the frequency(ies) generated and used by the equipment, only signals conducted onto the AC power lines are required to be measured.

(d) Particular attention should be paid to harmonics and subharmonics of the fundamental frequency as well as to those frequencies removed from the fundamental by multiples of the oscillator frequency. Radiation at the frequencies of multiplier states should also be checked.
