(a) A change may be made in a licensed transmitter without specific authorization from the Commission provided that the change does not result in operations inconsistent with any term of the outstanding authorization for the station involved.

(b) Discrete changes in emission characteristics may be made without specific authorization from the Commission provided that the Commission is given written notification demonstrating that such changes will not exceed the maximum emissions envelope established in the existing authorization. Changes made pursuant to such notification that become a permanent part of the licensee's experimental program must be listed in the licensee's next application for renewal.
              

(c) Prior authorization from the Commission is required before the following antenna changes may be made at a station at a fixed location:

(1) Any change that will either increase the height of a structure supporting the radiating portion of the antenna or decrease the height of a lighted antenna structure.

(2) Any change in the location of an antenna when such relocation involves a change in the geographic coordinates of latitude or longitude by as much as one second, or when such relocation involves a change in street address.
