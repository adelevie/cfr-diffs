(a) Any provision that applies to a cable operator under §§ 76.1000 through 76.1003 shall also apply to a common carrier or its affiliate that provides video programming by any means directly to subscribers. Any such provision that applies to a satellite cable programming vendor in which a cable operator has an attributable interest shall apply to any satellite cable programming vendor in which such common carrier has an attributable interest. For the purposes of this section, two or fewer common officers or directors shall not by itself establish an attributable interest by a common carrier in a satellite cable programming vendor (or its parent company) or a terrestrial cable programming vendor (or its parent company).

(b) Sections 76.1002(c)(1) through (3) shall be applied to a common carrier or its affiliate that provides video programming by any means directly to subscribers in such a way that such common carrier or its affiliate shall be generally restricted from entering into an exclusive arrangement for satellite cable programming or satellite broadcast programming with a satellite cable programming vendor in which a common carrier or its affiliate has an attributable interest or a satellite broadcast programming vendor in which a common carrier or its affiliate has an attributable interest, unless the arrangement pertains to an area served by a cable system as of October 5, 1992, and the Commission determines in accordance with Section § 76.1002(c)(4) that such arrangment is in the public interest.
