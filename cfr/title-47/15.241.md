(a) Operation under the provisions of this section is restricted to biomedical telemetry devices.

(b) Emissions from the device shall be confined within a 200 kHz band which shall lie wholly within the frequency range of 174-216 MHz.

(c) The field strength of any emissions radiated within the specified 200 kHz band shall not exceed 1500 microvolts/meter at 3 meters. The field strength of emissions radiated on any frequency outside of the specified 200 kHz band shall not exceed 150 microvolts/meter at 3 meters. The emission limits in this paragraph are based on measurement instrumentation employing an average detector. The provisions in ยง 15.35 for limiting peak emissions apply.
