(b) The 406.0-406.1 EPIRB must contain as an integral part a “homing” beacon operating only on 121.500 MHz that meets all the requirements described in the RTCM Recommended Standards document described in paragraph (a) of this section. The 121.500 MHz “homing” beacon must have a continuous duty cycle that may be interrupted during the transmission of the 406.0-406.1 MHz signal only. Additionally, at least 30 percent of the total power emitted during any transmission cycle must be contained within plus or minus 30 Hz of the carrier frequency.

(c) Prior to submitting a certification application for 406.0-406.1 MHz radiobeacon, the radiobeacon must be certified by a test facility recognized by one of the COSPAS-SARSAT Partners that the equipment satisfies the design characteristics associated with the measurement methods described in COSPAS-SARSAT Standards C/S T.001, “Specification for COSPAS-SARSAT 406 MHz Distress Beacons,” Issue 3—Revision 4, October 2002, and C/S T.007, “COSPAS-SARSAT 406 MHz Distress Beacon Type Approval Standard,” Issue 3—Revision 9, October 2002. Additionally, the radiobeacon must be subjected to the environmental and operational tests associated with the test procedures described in Appendix A of RTCM Standard 11000.2 (RTCM Paper 77-2002/SC110-STD, Version 2.1) for 406 MHz Satellite Emergency Position-Indicating Radiobeacons (EPIRBs), June 20, 2002, by a test facility accepted by the U.S. Coast Guard for this purpose.

(1) After a 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB has been certified by the recognized test facilities the following information must be submitted in duplicate to the Commandant (G-MSE), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 2nd Street SW, Washington, DC 20593-0001:

(i) The name of the manufacturer or grantee and model number of the EPIRB;

(ii) Copies of the certificate and test data obtained from the test facility recognized by a COSPAS/SARSAT Partner showing that the radiobeacon complies with the COSPAS/SARSAT design characteristics associated with the measurement methods described in the COSPAS-SARSAT Standards C/S T.001, “Specification for COSPAS-SARSAT 406 MHz Distress Beacons,” Issue 3—Revision 4, October 2002, and T.007, “COSPAS-SARSAT 406 MHz Distress Beacon Type Approval Standard,” Issue 3—Revision 9, October 2002, and RTCM Paper 77-2002/SC110-STD, “RTCM Standard 11000.2 for 406 MHz Satellite Emergency Position-Indicating Radiobeacons (EPIRBs),” Version 2.1, June 20, 2002. The COSPAS-SARSAT Standards C/S T.001 and T.007, and the RTCM Standard 11000.2 are incorporated by reference. The Director of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of the COSPAS-SARSAT Standards can be inspected at the Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th Street, SW., Washington, DC (Reference Information Center) or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC. The COSPAS-SARSAT Standards may be obtained from COSPAS-SARSAT Secretariat, c/o Inmarsat, 99 City Road, London EC1Y 1AX, United Kingdom, Telephone: +44 20-7728 1391, Facsimile: +44 20-7728 1170; www.cospas-sarsat.org. The RTCM Recommended Standards can be purchased from the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services, 1800 N. Kent St., Suite 1060, Arlington, VA 22209, http://www.rtcm.org, e-mail at pubs@rtcm.org;
              

(iii) Copies of the test report and test data obtained from the test facility recognized by the U.S. Coast Guard showing that the radiobeacon complies with the U.S. Coast Guard environmental and operational characteristics associated with the measurement methods described in Appendix A of the RTCM Recommended Standards; and

(iv) Instruction manuals associated with the radiobeacon, description of the test characteristics of the radiobeacon including assembly drawings, electrical schematics, description of parts list, specifications of materials and the manufacturer's quality assurance program.

(2) After reviewing the information described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section the U.S. Coast Guard will issue a letter stating whether the radiobeacon satisfies all RTCM Recommended Standards.

(d) A certification application for a 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB submitted to the Commission must also contain a copy of the U.S. Coast Guard letter that states the radiobeacon satisfies all RTCM Recommended Standards, a copy of the technical test data, and the instruction manual(s).

(e) An identification code, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Program Manager for the 406.0-406.1 MHz COSPAS/SARSAT satellite system, must be programmed in each EPIRB unit to establish a unique identification for each EPIRB station. With each marketable EPIRB unit, the manufacturer or grantee must include a postage pre-paid registration card printed with the EPIRB identification code addressed to: NOAA/SARSAT Beacon Registration, E/SP3, Federal Building 4, Room 3320, 5200 Auth Road, Suitland, MD 20746-4304. The registration card must request the owner's name, address, telephone number, type of ship, alternate emergency contact and other information as required by NOAA. The registration card must also contain information regarding the availability to register the EPIRB at NOAA's online web-based registration database at: http://www/beaconregistration.noaa.gov. In addition, the following statement must be included: “WARNING—failure to register this EPIRB with NOAA before installation could result in a monetary forfeiture being issued to the owner.”

(f) To enhance protection of life and property it is mandatory that each 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB be registered with NOAA before installation and that information be kept up-to-date. Therefore, in addition to the identification plate or label requirements contained in §§ 2.925 and 2.926 of this chapter, each 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB must be provided on the outside with a clearly discernible permanent plate or label containing the following statement: “The owner of this 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRB must register the NOAA identification code contained on this label with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) whose address is: NOAA, NOAA/SARSAT Beacon Registration, E/SP3, Federal Building 4, Room 3320, 5200 Auth Road, Suitland, MD 20746-4304.” Vessel owners shall advise NOAA in writing upon change of vessel or EPIRB ownership, transfer of EPIRB to another vessel, or any other change in registration information. NOAA will provide registrants with proof of registration and change of registration postcards.

(g) For 406.0-406.1 MHz EPIRBs whose identification code can be changed after manufacture, the identification code shown on the plate or label must be easily replaceable using commonly available tools.
