(a) Applications which are determined to be patently not in accordance with the FCC rules, regulations, or other requirements, unless accompanied by an appropriate request for waiver, will be considered defective and will not be accepted for filing or if inadvertently accepted for filing will be dismissed. Requests for waiver shall show the nature of the waiver or exception desired and shall set forth the reasons in support thereof.

(b) If an applicant is requested by the FCC to file any additional documents or information not included in the prescribed application form, a failure to comply with such request will be deemed to render the application defective, and such application will be dismissed.
