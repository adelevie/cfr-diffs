(a) Except for compulsory vessels, each ship radiotelephone station licensed to operate in the band 1605-3500 kHz must be able to receive and transmit J3E emission on the frequency 2182 kHz. Ship stations are additionally authorized to receive and transmit H3E emission for communications with foreign coast stations and with vessels of foreign registry. If the station is used for other than safety communications, it must be capable also of receiving and transmitting the J3E emission on at least two other frequencies in that band. However, ship stations which operate exclusively on the Mississippi River and its connecting waterways, and on high frequency bands above 3500 kHz, need be equipped with 2182 kHz and one other frequency within the band 1605-3500 kHz.
                

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, at least one VHF radiotelephone transmitter/receiver must be able to transmit and receive on the following frequencies:

(1) The distress, safety and calling frequency 156.800 MHz;

(2) The primary intership safety frequency 156.300 MHz;

(3) One or more working frequencies; and

(4) All other frequencies necessary for its service.

(c) Where a ship ordinarily has no requirement for VHF communications, handheld VHF equipment may be used solely to comply with the bridge-to-bridge navigational communication requirements contained in subpart U of this part.
