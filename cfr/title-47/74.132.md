The license for experimental broadcast stations will specify the maximum authorized power. The operating power shall not be greater than necessary to carry on the service and in no event more than 5 percent above the maximum power specified. Engineering standards have not been established for these stations. The efficiency factor for the last radio stage of transmitters employed will be subject to individual determination but shall be in general agreement with values normally employed for similar equipment operated within the frequency range authorized.
