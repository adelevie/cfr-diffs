(a) An applicant for a new experimental broadcast station, change in facilities of any existing station, or modification of license is required to make a satisfactory showing of compliance with the general requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, as well as the following:

(1) That the applicant has a definite program of research and experimentation in the technical phases of broadcasting which indicates reasonable promise of substantial contribution to the developments of the broadcasting art.

(2) That upon the authorization of the proposed station the applicant can and will proceed immediately with its program of research and experimentation.

(3) That the transmission of signals by radio is essential to the proposed program of research and experimentation.

(4) That the program of research and experimentation will be conducted by qualified personnel.

(b) A license of an experimental broadcast station will not authorize exclusive use of any frequency. In case interference would be caused by simultaneous operation of stations licensed experimentally, such licensees shall endeavor to arrange satisfactory time division. If such agreement cannot be reached, the FCC will determine and specify the time division.

(c) A license for an experimental broadcast station will be issued only on the condition that no objectionable interference to the regular program transmissions of broadcast stations will result from the transmissions of the experimental stations.
