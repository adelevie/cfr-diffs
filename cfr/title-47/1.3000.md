The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 which amended the Communications Act by creating section 4(g)(3), 47 U.S.C. 154(g)(3). The provisions of this subpart shall apply to gifts, donations and bequests made to the Commission itself. Travel reimbursement for attendance at, or participation in, government-sponsored meetings or events required to carry out the Commission's statutory or regulatory functions may also be accepted under this subpart. The acceptance of gifts by Commission employees, most notably gifts of food, drink and entertainment, is governed by the government-wide standards of employee conduct established at 5 CFR part 2635. Travel, subsistence and related expenses for non-government-sponsored meetings or events will continue to be accepted pursuant to the Government Employees Training Act, 41 U.S.C. 4111 or 31 U.S.C. 1353, and its General Services Administration's implementing regulations, 41 CFR 304-1.8, as applicable.
