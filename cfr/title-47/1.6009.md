If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one person in the local market of such station and has failed to meet its burden of proving one of the defenses under § 1.6005 (a)(2) through (a)(4) with respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall:

(a) Make a finding that the satellite carrier violated 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to that station; and

(b) Issue an order, within forty-five (45) days after the filing of the complaint, containing—

(1) A cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier immediately to stop making any further retransmissions of the television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station until such time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance with 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to such station;

(2) If the satellite carrier is found to have violated 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to more than two television broadcast stations, a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier to stop making any further retransmission of any television broadcast station to any person within the local market of the stations identified in the cease-and-desist order, until such time as the Commission, after giving notice to the station, determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance with 47 U.S.C. 325(b)(1) with respect to such stations; and

(3) An award to the complainant of that complainant's costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Such award shall be made only after the complainant submits appropriate documentation in support of its request.

(c) Any cease-and-desist order issued hereunder shall include a statement of findings and the grounds therefor, shall specify the effective date of the order, and shall be served by the Commission upon the satellite carrier to which such order is directed.
