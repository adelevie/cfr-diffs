A renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding shall receive a preference, commonly referred to as a renewal expectancy, which is the most important comparative factor to be considered in the proceeding, if its past record for the relevant license period demonstrates that the renewal applicant:

(a) Has provided “substantial” service during its past license term. “Substantial” service is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which might just minimally warrant renewal; and

(b) Has substantially complied with applicable Commission rules, policies and the Communications Act.
