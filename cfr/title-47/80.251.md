Each separate motor-generator, rectifier, or other unit required to convert the ship primary power to the phase, frequency, or voltage necessary to energize the transmitter unit is considered a component of the transmitter.

(d) Average ship station antenna means an actual antenna installed on board ship having a capacitance of 750 picofarads and an effective resistance of 4 ohms at a frequency of 500 kHz, or an artificial antenna having the same electrical characteristics.
