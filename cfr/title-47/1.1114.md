(a) Any instrument of authorization granted by the Commission, or by its staff under delegated authority, will be conditioned upon final payment of the applicable fee or delinquent fees and timely payment of bills issued by the Commission. As applied to checks, bank drafts and money orders, final payment shall mean receipt by the Treasury of funds cleared by the financial institution on which the check, bank draft or money order is drawn.

(1) If, prior to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the Commission is notified that final payment has not been made, the application or filing will be:

(i) Dismissed and returned to the applicant;
              

(ii) Shall lose its place in the processing line;

(iii) And will not be accorded nunc pro tunc treatment if resubmitted after the relevant filing deadline.

(2) If, subsequent to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the Commission is notified that final payment has not been made, the Commission will:

(i) Automatically rescind that instrument of authorization for failure to meet the condition imposed by this subsection; and

(ii) Notify the grantee of this action; and

(iii) Not permit nunc pro tunc treatment for the resubmission of the application or filing if the relevant deadline has expired.

(3) Upon receipt of a notification of rescision of the authorization, the grantee will immediately cease operations initiated pursuant to the authorization.

(b) In those instances where the Commission has granted a request for deferred payment of a fee or issued a bill payable at a future date, further processing of the application or filing, or the grant of authority, shall be conditioned upon final payment of the fee, plus other required payments for late payments, by the date prescribed by the deferral decision or bill. Failure to comply with the terms of the deferral decision or bill shall result in the automatic dismissal of the submission or rescision of the Commission authorization for failure to meet the condition imposed by this subpart. The Commission reserves the right to return payments received after the date established on the bill and exercise the conditions attached to the application. The Commission shall:

(1) Notify the grantee that the authorization has been rescinded;

(i) Upon such notification, the grantee will immediately cease operations initiated pursuant to the authorization.

 (ii) [Reserved]

(2) Not permit nunc pro tunc treatment to applicants who attempt to refile after the original deadline for the underlying submission.

(c) (1) Where an applicant is found to be delinquent in the payment of application fees, the Commission will make a written request for the delinquent fee, together with any penalties that may be due under this subpart. Such request shall inform the applicant/filer that failure to pay or make satisfactory payment arrangements will result in the Commission's withholding action on, and/or as appropriate, dismissal of, any applications or requests filed by the applicant. The staff shall also inform the applicant of the procedures for seeking Commission review of the staff's fee determination.

(2) If, after final determination that the fee is due or that the applicant is delinquent in the payment of fees, and payment is not made in a timely manner, the staff will withhold action on the application or filing until payment or other satisfactory arrangement is made. If payment or satisfactory arrangement is not made within 30 days of the date of the original notification, the application will be dismissed.
