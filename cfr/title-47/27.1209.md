(a) Any EBS or BRS station licensed by the Commission, other than BTA authorizations and facilities authorized pursuant to BTA authorizations, shall be considered an incumbent station.

(b) As of January 10, 2005, all incumbent EBS and BRS licenses shall be converted to a geographic area license. Pursuant to that geographic area license, such incumbent licensees may modify their systems provided the modified system complies with the applicable rules. The blanket license covers all fixed stations anywhere within the authorized service area, except as follows:
              

(1) A station would be required to be individually licensed if

(i) International agreements require coordination;

(ii) Submission of an Environmental Assessment is required under § 1.1307 of this chapter;

(iii) The station would affect the radio quiet zones under § 1.924 of this chapter.

(2) Any antenna structure that requires notification to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must be registered with the Commission prior to construction under § 17.4 of this chapter.

(c) The frequencies associated with incumbent authorizations that have been cancelled automatically or otherwise been recovered by the Commission will automatically revert to the applicable BTA licensee.
