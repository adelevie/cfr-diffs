(a) The Commission has adopted an initial policy statement that supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution procedures in its administrative proceedings and proceedings in which the Commission is a party, including the use of regulatory negotiation in Commission rulemaking matters, as authorized under the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act and Negotiated Rulemaking Act.

(b) In accordance with the Commission's policy to encourage the fullest possible use of alternative dispute resolution procedures in its administrative proceedings, procedures contained in the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, including the provisions dealing with confidentiality, shall also be applied in Commission alternative dispute resolution proceedings in which the Commission itself is not a party to the dispute.
