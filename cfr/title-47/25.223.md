(a) This section applies to all applications for earth station licenses in the 17/24 GHz BSS frequency bands, except for applications in which the proposed antenna does not conform to the standards of §§ 25.209(a) and (b), and/or the proposed power density levels are in excess of those specified in § 25.212(f) of this part.

(b) All applications for earth station licenses in the 24.75-25.25 GHz portion of 17/24 GHz BSS shall be routinely processed if they meet the following requirements:

(1) 17/24 GHz BSS earth station antenna off-axis EIRP spectral density for co-polarized signals shall not exceed the following values, within ±3° of the GSO arc, under clear sky conditions:

(2) 17/24 GHz BSS earth station antenna off-axis EIRP spectral density for co-polarized signals shall not exceed the following values, for all directions other than within ±3° of the GSO arc, under clear sky conditions:

(3) The values given in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section may be exceeded by 3 dB, for values of θ > 10°, provided that the total angular range over which this occurs does not exceed 20° when measured along both sides of the GSO arc.

(4) 17/24 GHz BSS earth station antenna off-axis EIRP spectral density for cross-polarized signals shall not exceed the following values, in all directions greater than +3 relative to the GSO arc, under clear sky conditions:

(c) Notwithstanding § 25.220 of this part, each applicant for earth station license(s) that proposes levels in excess of those defined in paragraph (b) of this section shall:

(1) Submit link budget analyses of the operations proposed along with a detailed written explanation of how each uplink and each transmitted satellite carrier density figure is derived;

(2) Submit a narrative summary which must indicate whether there are margin shortfalls in any of the current baseline services as a result of the addition of the applicant's higher power service, and if so, how the applicant intends to resolve those margin short falls;

(3) Certify that all potentially affected parties acknowledge and do not object to the use of the applicant's higher power densities. For proposed power levels less than or equal to 3 dB in excess of the limits defined above, the affected parties shall be those co-frequency U.S. licensed 17/24 GHz BSS satellite networks that are located at angular separations of up to ±6° away; for power levels greater than 3 dB and less than or equal to 6 dB in excess of the limits defined above, affected parties shall be all those co-frequency U.S. licensed operators at up to ±10° away. No power levels greater than 6 dB in excess of the limits defined above shall be permitted.

(d) Licensees authorized pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall bear the burden of coordinating with any future applicants or licensees whose proposed compliant operations at 10 degrees or smaller orbital spacing, as defined by paragraph (b) of this section, is potentially or actually adversely affected by the operation of the non-compliant licensee. If no good faith agreement can be reached, however, the non-compliant licensee shall reduce its earth station EIRP spectral density levels to be compliant with those specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

(e) For earth stations employing uplink power control, the values in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), and (4) of this section may be exceeded by up to 20 dB under conditions of uplink fading due to precipitation. The amount of such increase in excess of the actual amount of monitored excess attenuation over clear sky propagation conditions shall not exceed 1.5 dB or 15% of the actual amount of monitored excess attenuation in dB, whichever is larger, with a confidence level of 90 percent except over transient periods accounting for no more than 0.5% of the time during which the excess is no more than 4.0 dB.
