(a) All 38.6-40.0 GHz band licensees must demonstrate substantial service at the time of license renewal. A licensee's substantial service showing should include, but not be limited to, the following information for each channel for which they hold a license, in each EA or portion of an EA covered by their license, in order to qualify for renewal of that license. The information provided will be judged by the Commission to determine whether the licensee is providing service which rises to the level of “substantial.”

(1) A description of the 38.6-40.0 GHz band licensee's current service in terms of geographic coverage;

(2) A description of the 38.6-40.0 GHz band licensee's current service in terms of population served, as well as any additional service provided during the license term;

(3) A description of the 38.6-40.0 GHz band licensee's investments in its system(s) (type of facilities constructed and their operational status is required);
                                    

(b) Any 38.6-40.0 GHz band licensees adjudged not to be providing substantial service will not have their licenses renewed.
