(a) Each carrier may use a retention medium of its choice to preserve records in lieu of original records, provided that they observe the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

(b) A paper or microfilm record need not be created to satisfy the requirements of this part if the record is initially prepared in machine-readable medium such as punched cards, magnetic tapes, and disks. Each record kept in a machine-readable medium shall be accompanied by a statement clearly indicating the type of data included in the record and certifying that the information contained in it has been accurately duplicated. This statement shall be executed by a person duplicating the records. The records shall be indexed and retained in such a manner that they are easily accessible, and the carrier shall have the facilities available to locate, identify and reproduce the records in readable form without loss of clarity.

(c) Records may be retained on microfilm provided they meet the requirements of the Federal Business Records Act (28 U.S.C. 1732).
