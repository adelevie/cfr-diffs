A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts shall be made by the Federal Communications Commission upon its own initiative or upon the submission of written request therefor from any telecommunications company, or group of telecommunications companies, provided that such a waiver is in the public interest and each request for waiver expressly demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or technique; a specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in the provisions of this system of accounts; and the application of such alternative procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive results as among telecommunications companies.
