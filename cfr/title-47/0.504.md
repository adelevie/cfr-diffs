(a) Responses to mandatory declassification review requests shall be governed by the amount of search and review time required to process the request. A final determination shall be made within one year from the date of receipt of the request, except in unusual circumstances.

(b) Upon a determination by the bureau or office that the requested material originally classified by the Commission no longer warrants protection, it shall be declassified and made available to the requester, unless withholding is otherwise authorized under law.

(c) If the information may not be declassified or released in whole or in part, the requester shall be notified as to the reasons for the denial, given notice of the right to appeal the denial to the Classification Review Committee, and given notice that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days of the date of denial in order to be considered.

(d) The Commission's Classification Review Committee, consisting of the Managing Director (Chairman), the General Counsel or his designee, and the Chief, Internal Review and Security Division, shall have authority to act, within 30 days, upon all appeals regarding denials of requests for mandatory declassification of Commission-originated classifications. The Committee shall be authorized to overrule previous determinations in whole or in part when, in its judgment, continued classification is no longer required. If the Committee determines that continued classification is required under the criteria of the Order, the requester shall be promptly notified and advised that an application for review may be filed with the Commission pursuant to 47 CFR 1.115.
