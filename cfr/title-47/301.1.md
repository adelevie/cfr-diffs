Pursuant to section 3005 of the Act, (The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005), the purpose of the Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Coupon Program is to provide $40 coupons that can be applied towards the purchase price of eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes. After February 17, 2009, the Federal Communications Commission will require that all full-power television stations in the United States broadcast using digital television technology. Consumers who wish to continue to receive local broadcast television programming over-the-air using analog televisions not connected to cable or satellite service may wish to purchase digital-to-analog converter boxes in order to do so.
