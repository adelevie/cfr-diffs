An SMR license initially authorized on any of the channels listed in Tables 4 and 5 of ยง 90.617 may transfer or assign its channel(s) to another entity subject to the provisions of ยง 1.948 of this chapter and ยง 90.609(b). If the proposed transferee or assignee is the EA licensee for the spectrum block to which the channel is allocated, such transfer or assignment presumptively will be deemed to be in the public interest. However, such presumption will be rebuttable.
