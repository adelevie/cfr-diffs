(v) Are more than 2.5 MHz outside of the 2360-2400 MHz band (for devices designed to operate in the 2360-2400 MHz band).
                                    

(7) For devices designed to operate in the 2360-2400 MHz band: In the first 2.5 megahertz beyond any of the frequency bands authorized for MBAN operation, the EIRP level associated with any unwanted emission must be attenuated within a 1 megahertz bandwidth by at least 20 dB relative to the maximum EIRP level within any 1 megahertz of the fundamental emission.
