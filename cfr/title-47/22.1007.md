The channels listed in this section are allocated for paired assignment to transmitters located in the specified geographical zones that provide offshore radiotelephone service. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

(a) Zone A—Southern Louisiana. The geographical area in Zone A is bounded as follows:
              

(1) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for voice-grade general communications:

(2) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for voice-grade general communications and private line service:
              

(3) These channels may be assigned for use by relay stations in systems where it would be impractical to provide offshore radiotelephone service without the use of relay stations.

(4) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for emergency communications involving protection of life and property.

(5) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for emergency auto alarm and voice transmission pertaining to emergency conditions only.

(6) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for emergency shut-off remote control telemetry, environmental data acquisition and disseminations, or facsimile transmissions.

(7) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for private line service:

(8) Interstitial channels. Interstitial channels are those with center frequencies offset by ±12.5 kHz from the listed center frequencies. The FCC may assign interstitial channels to offshore stations in Zone A subject to the following conditions:

(i) Offshore stations transmitting on interstitial channels must be located east of W.92° longitude.

(ii) Operations on interstitial channels are considered to be secondary to operations on channels with the listed center frequencies.

(iii) Offshore stations operating on interstitial channels must be used only for voice grade general communications or to provide for private line service.
              

(b) Zone B—Southern Louisiana—Texas. (1) The geographical area in Zone B is bounded as follows:
              

(2) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for voice-grade general communications and private line service:
              

(c) Zone C—Southern Texas. The geographical area in Zone C is bounded as follows:
              

(1) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for emergency auto alarm and voice transmission pertaining to emergency conditions only.

(2) These channels may be assigned for use by offshore central (base/fixed) or subscriber stations (fixed, temporary fixed, surface and/or airborne mobile) as indicated, for voice-grade general communications and private line service:
