This section sets forth the band plan for the 763-775 MHz and 793-805 MHz public safety bands.

(a) Base and mobile use. The 763-775 MHz band may be used for base, mobile or fixed (repeater) transmissions. The 793-805 MHz band may be used only for mobile or fixed (control) transmissions.

(b) Narrowband segments. There are two band segments that are designated for use with narrowband emissions. Each of these narrowband segments is divided into 960 channels having a channel size of 6.25 kHz as follows:

(1) Narrowband interoperability channels. The following narrowband channels are designated for nationwide interoperability licensing and use: 23, 24, 39, 40, 63, 64, 79, 80, 103, 104, 119, 120,143, 144, 159, 160, 183, 184, 199, 200, 223, 224, 239, 240, 263, 264, 279, 280, 303, 304, 319, 320, 641, 642, 657, 658, 681, 682, 697, 698, 721, 722, 737, 738, 761, 762, 777, 778, 801, 802, 817, 818, 841, 842, 857, 858, 881, 882, 897, 898, 921, 922, 937, 938, 983, 984, 999, 1000, 1023, 1024, 1039, 1040, 1063, 1064, 1079, 1080, 1103, 1104, 1119, 1120, 1143, 1144, 1159, 1160, 1183, 1184, 1199, 1200, 1223, 1224, 1239, 1240, 1263, 1264, 1279, 1280, 1601, 1602, 1617, 1618, 1641, 1642, 1657, 1658, 1681, 1682, 1697, 1698, 1721, 1722, 1737, 1738, 1761, 1762, 1777, 1778, 1801, 1802, 1817, 1818, 1841, 1842, 1857, 1858, 1881, 1882, 1897, 1898.

They may not be used primarily for routine, day-to-day communications. Encryption is prohibited on the designated calling channels.

(iii) Narrowband trunking Interoperability channels. The following Interoperability channel pairs may be combined with the appropriate adjacent secondary trunking channel pairs and used in trunked mode on a secondary basis to conventional Interoperability operations: 23/983, 24/984, 103/1063, 104/1064, 183/1143, 184/1144, 263/1223, 264/1224, 657/1617, 658/1618, 737/1697, 738/1698, 817/1777, 818/1778, 897/1857, 898/1858. For every ten general use channels trunked at a station, entities may obtain a license to operate in the trunked mode on two of the above contiguous Interoperability channel pairs. The maximum number of Interoperability channel pairs that can be trunked at any one location is eight.

(2) Narrowband reserve channels. The following narrowband channels are undesignated and reserved: 37, 38, 61, 62, 77, 78, 117, 118, 141, 142, 157, 158, 197, 198, 221, 222, 237, 238, 277, 278, 301, 302, 317, 318, 643, 644, 683, 684, 699, 700, 723, 724, 763, 764, 779, 780, 803, 804, 843, 844, 859, 860, 883, 884, 923, 924, 939, 940, 997, 998, 1021, 1022, 1037, 1038, 1077, 1078, 1101, 1102, 1117, 1118, 1157, 1158, 1181, 1182, 1197, 1198, 1237, 1238, 1261, 1262, 1277, 1278, 1603, 1604, 1643, 1644, 1659, 1660, 1683, 1684, 1723, 1724, 1739, 1740, 1763, 1764, 1803, 1804, 1819, 1820, 1843, 1844, 1883, 1884, 1899, 1900.

All narrowband channels established in paragraph (b) of this section, other than those listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section are designated to public safety eligibles subject to Commission approved regional planning committee regional plans. Voice operations on these channels are subject to compliance with the spectrum usage efficiency requirements set forth in § 90.535(d).

(7) Secondary trunking channels. The following channel pairs are reserved for secondary trunking operations: 21/981, 22/982, 101/1061, 102/1062, 181/1141, 182/1142, 261/1221, 262/1222, 659/1619, 660/1620, 739/1699, 740/1700, 819/1779, 820/1780, 899/1859, and 900/1860.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) Combining channels. Except as noted in this section, at the discretion of the appropriate regional planning committee, contiguous channels may be used in combination in order to accommodate requirements for larger bandwidth emissions, in accordance with this paragraph. Interoperability channels may not be combined with channels in another group except for channels for secondary trunking channels.

(1) Narrowband. Subject to compliance with the spectrum usage efficiency requirements set forth in § 90.535, two or four contiguous narrowband (6.25 kHz) channels may be used in combination as 12.5 kHz or 25 kHz channels, respectively. The lower (in frequency) channel for two channel combinations must be an odd (i.e., 1, 3, 5 * * *) numbered channel. The lowest (in frequency) channel for four channel combinations must be a channel whose number is equal to 1+(4xn), where n = any integer between 0 and 479, inclusive (e.g., channel number 1, 5, * * * 1917). Channel combinations are designated by the lowest and highest channel numbers separated by a hyphen, e.g., “1-2” for a two channel combination and “1-4” for a four channel combination.

(2) [Reserved]

(e) Channel pairing. In general, channels must be planned and assigned in base/mobile pairs that are separated by 30 MHz. However, until December 31, 2006, channels other than those listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1), may be planned and assigned in base/mobile pairs having a different separation, where necessary because 30 MHz base/mobile pairing is precluded by the presence of one or more co-channel or adjacent channel TV/DTV broadcast stations.

(f) Internal guard band. The internal guard band (768-769/798-799 MHz) is reserved.

(g) Broadband. The 763-768 MHz and 793-798 MHz bands are allocated for broadband communications pursuant to the Public Safety Broadband License.
