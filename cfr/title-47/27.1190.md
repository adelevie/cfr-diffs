The plan for cost-sharing in connection with BRS relocation will sunset for all AWS entities fifteen years after the relocation sunset period for BRS relocation commences, i.e., fifteen years after the first AWS licenses are issued in any part of the 2150-2162 MHz band. AWS entrants that trigger a cost-sharing obligation prior to the sunset date must satisfy their payment obligation in full.
