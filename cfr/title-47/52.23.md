(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all local exchange carriers (LECs) must provide number portability in compliance with the following performance criteria:

(1) Supports network services, features, and capabilities existing at the time number portability is implemented, including but not limited to emergency services, CLASS features, operator and directory assistance services, and intercept capabilities;

(2) Efficiently uses numbering resources;

(3) Does not require end users to change their telecommunications numbers;

(4) Does not result in unreasonable degradation in service quality or network reliability when implemented;

(5) Does not result in any degradation in service quality or network reliability when customers switch carriers;

(6) Does not result in a carrier having a proprietary interest;

(7) Is able to migrate to location and service portability; and

(8) Has no significant adverse impact outside the areas where number portability is deployed.

(b)(1) All LECs must provide a long-term database method for number portability in the 100 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), as defined in § 52.21(k), in switches for which another carrier has made a specific request for the provision of number portability, subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(2) Any procedure to identify and request switches for deployment of number portability must comply with the following criteria:

(i) Any wireline carrier that is certified (or has applied for certification) to provide local exchange service in a state, or any licensed CMRS provider, must be permitted to make a request for deployment of number portability in that state;

(ii) Carriers must submit requests for deployment at least nine months before the deployment deadline for the MSA;

(iii) A LEC must make available upon request to any interested parties a list of its switches for which number portability has been requested and a list of its switches for which number portability has not been requested; and

(iv) After the deadline for deployment of number portability in an MSA in the 100 largest MSAs, according to the deployment schedule set forth in the appendix to this part, a LEC must deploy number portability in that MSA in additional switches upon request within the following time frames:

(A) For remote switches supported by a host switch equipped for portability (“Equipped Remote Switches”), within 30 days;

(B) For switches that require software but not hardware changes to provide portability (“Hardware Capable Switches”), within 60 days;

(C) For switches that require hardware changes to provide portability (“Capable Switches Requiring Hardware”), within 180 days; and

(D) For switches not capable of portability that must be replaced (“Non-Capable Switches”), within 180 days.

(c) Beginning January 1, 1999, all LECs must make a long-term database method for number portability available within six months after a specific request by another telecommunications carrier in areas in which that telecommunications carrier is operating or plans to operate.

(d) The Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, may waive or stay any of the dates in the implementation schedule, as the Chief determines is necessary to ensure the efficient development of number portability, for a period not to exceed 9 months (i.e., no later than September 30, 1999).

(e) In the event a LEC is unable to meet the Commission's deadlines for implementing a long-term database method for number portability, it may file with the Commission at least 60 days in advance of the deadline a petition to extend the time by which implementation in its network will be completed. A LEC seeking such relief must demonstrate through substantial, credible evidence the basis for its contention that it is unable to comply with the deployment schedule set forth in the appendix to this part 52. Such requests must set forth:

(1) The facts that demonstrate why the carrier is unable to meet the Commission's deployment schedule;

(2) A detailed explanation of the activities that the carrier has undertaken to meet the implementation schedule prior to requesting an extension of time;

(3) An identification of the particular switches for which the extension is requested;

(4) The time within which the carrier will complete deployment in the affected switches; and

(5) A proposed schedule with milestones for meeting the deployment date.

(f) The Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau, shall monitor the progress of local exchange carriers implementing number portability, and may direct such carriers to take any actions necessary to ensure compliance with the deployment schedule set forth in the appendix to this part 52.

(g) Carriers that are members of the Illinois Local Number Portability Workshop must conduct a field test of any technically feasible long-term database method for number portability in the Chicago, Illinois, area. The carriers participating in the test must jointly file with the Common Carrier Bureau a report of their findings within 30 days following completion of the test. The Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, shall monitor developments during the field test, and may adjust the field test completion deadline as necessary.

(h)(1) Porting from a wireline carrier to a wireless carrier is required where the requesting wireless carrier's “coverage area,” as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, overlaps the geographic location in which the customer's wireline number is provisioned, provided that the porting-in carrier maintains the number's original rate center designation following the port.

(2) The wireless “coverage area” is defined as the area in which wireless service can be received from the wireless carrier.
