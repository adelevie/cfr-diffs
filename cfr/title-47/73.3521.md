When there is a pending application for a new low power television, television translator, or television booster station, or for major changes in an existing station, no other application which would be directly mutually exclusive with the pending application may be filed by the same applicant or by any applicant in which any individual in common with the pending application has any interest, direct or indirect, except that interests or less than 1% will not be considered.
