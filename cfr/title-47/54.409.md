(a) To qualify to receive Lifeline service in a state that mandates state Lifeline support, a consumer must meet the eligibility criteria established by the state commission for such support. The state commission shall establish narrowly targeted qualification criteria that are based solely on income or factors directly related to income. A state containing geographic areas included in the definition of “reservation” and “near reservation,” as defined in § 54.400(e), must ensure that its qualification criteria are reasonably designed to apply to low-income individuals living in such areas.

(b) To qualify to receive Lifeline service in a state that does not mandate state Lifeline support, a consumer's income, as defined in § 54.400(f), must be at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or a consumer must participate in one of the following federal assistance programs: Medicaid; Food Stamps; Supplemental Security Income; Federal Public Housing Assistance (Section 8); Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program; National School Lunch Program's free lunch program; or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.

(c) A consumer that lives on a reservation or near a reservation, but does not meet the qualifications for Lifeline specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, nonetheless shall be a “qualifying low-income consumer” as defined in § 54.400(a) and thus an “eligible resident of Tribal lands” as defined in § 54.400(e) and shall qualify to receive Tiers One, Two, and Four Lifeline service if the individual participates in one of the following federal assistance programs: Bureau of Indian Affairs general assistance; Tribally administered Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; Head Start (only those meeting its income qualifying standard); or National School Lunch Program's free lunch program. Such qualifying low-income consumer shall also qualify for Tier-Three Lifeline support, if the carrier offering the Lifeline service is not subject to the regulation of the state and provides carrier-matching funds, as described in § 54.403(a)(3). To receive Lifeline support under this paragraph for the eligible resident of Tribal lands, the eligible telecommunications carrier offering the Lifeline service to such consumer must obtain the consumer's signature on a document certifying under penalty of perjury that the consumer receives benefits from at least one of the programs mentioned in this paragraph or paragraph (b) of this section, and lives on or near a reservation, as defined in § 54.400(e). In addition to identifying in that document the program or programs from which that consumer receives benefits, an eligible resident of Tribal lands also must agree to notify the carrier if that consumer ceases to participate in the program or programs. Such qualifying low-income consumer shall also qualify for Tier-Three Lifeline support, if the carrier offering the Lifeline service is not subject to the regulation of the state and provides carrier-matching funds, as described in § 54.403(a)(3).

(d) In a state that does not mandate state Lifeline support, each eligible telecommunications carrier providing Lifeline service to a qualifying low-income consumer pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section must obtain that consumer's signature on a document certifying under penalty of perjury that:

(1) The consumer receives benefits from one of the programs listed in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, and identifying the program or programs from which that consumer receives benefits, or

(2) The consumer's household meets the income requirement of paragraph (b) of this section, and that the presented documentation of income, as described in §§ 54.400(f), 54.410(a)(ii), accurately represents the consumer's household income; and

(3) The consumer will notify the carrier if that consumer ceases to participate in the program or programs or if the consumer's income exceeds 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.
