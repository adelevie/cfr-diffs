(a) In order for public safety licensees to qualify for a three year mandatory negotiation period as defined in ยง 101.69(d)(2), the department head responsible for system oversight must certify to the ET licensee requesting relocation that:

(1) The agency is a Police licensee, a Fire Licensee, or an Emergency Medical Licensee as defined in ยง 90.7 of this chapter, or meets the eligibility requirements of ยง 90.20(a)(2) of this chapter, except for ยง 90.20(a)(2)(ii) of this chapter, or that it is a licensee of other part 101 facilities licensed on a primary basis under the eligibility requirements of part 90, subpart B of this chapter; and
                                    

(2) The majority of communications carried on the facilities at issue involve safety of life and property.

(b) A public safety licensee must provide certification within thirty (30) days of a request from a ET licensee, or the ET licensee may presume that special treatment is inapplicable. If a public safety licensee falsely certifies to an ET licensee that it qualifies for the extended time periods, this licensee will be in violation of the Commission's rules and will subject to appropriate penalties, as well as immediately subject to the non-public safety time periods.
