(a) This account shall include the original cost of leasehold improvements made to telecommunications plant held under a capital or operating lease, which are subject to amortization treatment. This account shall also include those improvements which will revert to the lessor.

(b) Improvements to leased telecommunications plant which are of a relatively minor cost or short life or for which the period of the lease is one year or less shall be charged to the account chargeable with the cost of repairs to such plant.

(c) Amounts contained in this account shall be amortized over the term of the related lease. For Class A companies, except mid-sized incumbent local exchange carriers, the amortization associated with the costs recorded in the Leasehold improvement account will be credited directly to this asset account, leaving a balance representing the unamortized cost.
