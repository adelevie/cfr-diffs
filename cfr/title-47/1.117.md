(a) Within 40 days after public notice is given of any action taken pursuant to delegated authority, the Commission may on its own motion order the record of the proceeding before it for review.

(b) If the Commission reviews the proceeding on its own motion, it may order such further procedure as may be useful to it in its review of the action taken pursuant to delegated authority.

(c) With or without such further procedure, the Commission may either affirm, reverse, modify, or set aside the action taken, or remand the proceeding to the designated authority for reconsideration in accordance with its instructions. If an evidentiary hearing has been held, the Commission may remand the proceeding to the person(s) who conducted the hearing for rehearing on such issues and in accordance with such instructions as may be appropriate. An order of the Commission which reverses or modifies the action taken pursuant to delegated authority, or remands the matter for further proceedings, is subject to the same provisions with respect to reconsideration as an original action of the Commission.
