(a) A state commission may determine that the cost information available to it with respect to transport and termination of telecommunications traffic does not support the adoption of a rate or rates for an incumbent LEC that are consistent with the requirements of §§ 51.505 and 51.511. In that event, the state commission may establish rates for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic, or for specific components included therein, that are consistent with the proxies specified in this section, provided that:

(1) Any rate established through use of such proxies is superseded once that state commission establishes rates for transport and termination pursuant to §§ 51.705(a)(1) or 51.705(a)(3); and

(2) The state commission sets forth in writing a reasonable basis for its selection of a particular proxy for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic, or for specific components included within transport and termination.

(b) If a state commission establishes rates for transport and termination of telecommunications traffic on the basis of default proxies, such rates must meet the following requirements:

(1) Termination. The incumbent LEC's rates for the termination of telecommunications traffic shall be no greater than 0.4 cents ($0.004) per minute, and no less than 0.2 cents ($0.002) per minute, except that, if a state commission has, before August 8, 1996, established a rate less than or equal to 0.5 cents ($0.005) per minute for such calls, that rate may be retained pending completion of a forward-looking economic cost study.

(2) Transport. The incumbent LEC's rates for the transport of telecommunications traffic, under this section, shall comply with the proxies described in § 51.513(c) (3), (4), and (5) of this part that apply to the analogous unbundled network elements used in transporting a call to the end office that serves the called party.
