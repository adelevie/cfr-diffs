In addition to the other requirements set forth in this part for initial cellular applications, any application competing against a cellular renewal application must contain, when initially filed, appropriate documentation demonstrating that its proposed antenna site(s) will be available. Competing applications that do not include such documentation will be dismissed. If the competing applicant does not own a particular site, it must, at a minimum demonstrate that the site is available to it by providing a letter from the owner of the proposed antenna site expressing the owner's intent to sell or lease the proposed site to the applicant. If any proposed antenna site is under U.S. Government control, the applicant must submit written confirmation of the site's availability from the appropriate Government agency. Applicants which file competing applications against incumbent cellular licensees may not rely on the assumption that an incumbent licensee's antenna sites are available for their use.
