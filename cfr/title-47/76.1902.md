(b) Commercial audiovisual content shall mean works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines, or devices such as projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as films or tapes, in which the works are embodied, transmitted by a covered entity and that are:

(1) Not created by the user of a covered product, and

(2) Offered for transmission, either generally or on demand, to subscribers or purchasers or the public at large or otherwise for commercial purposes, not uniquely to an individual or a small, private group.

(c) Commercially adopted access control method shall mean any commercially adopted access control method including digitally controlled analog scrambling systems, whether now or hereafter in commercial use.

(d) Copy never shall mean, with respect to commercial audiovisual content, the encoding of such content so as to signal that such content may not to be copied by a covered product.

(e) Copy one generation shall mean, with respect to commercial audiovisual content, the encoding of such content so as to permit a first generation of copies to be made by a covered product but not copies of such first generation of copies.

(i) Defined business model shall mean video-on-demand, pay-per view, pay television transmission, non-premium subscription television, free conditional access delivery and unencrypted broadcast television.

(j) Encode shall mean, in the transmission of commercial audiovisual content, to pass, attach, embed, or otherwise apply to, associate with, or allow to persist in or remain associated with such content, data or information which when read or responded to in a covered device has the effect of preventing, pausing, or limiting copying, or constraining the resolution of a program when output from the covered device.

(l) Free conditional access delivery shall mean a delivery of a service, program, or schedule or group of programs via a commercially-adopted access control method, where viewers are not charged any fee (other than government-mandated fees) for the reception or viewing of the programming contained therein, other than unencrypted broadcast television.

(m) Non-premium subscription television shall mean a service, or schedule or group of programs (which may be offered for sale together with other services, or schedule or group of programs), for which subscribers are charged a subscription fee for the reception or viewing of the programming contained therein, other than pay television, subscription-on-demand and unencrypted broadcast television.

If a given delivery qualifies both as a pay television transmission and pay-per-view, video-on-demand, or subscription-on-demand then, for purposes of this subpart, such delivery shall be deemed pay-per-view, video-on-demand or subscription-on-demand rather than a pay television transmission.

In the event a given delivery of a program qualifies both as a pay television transmission and subscription-on-demand, then for purposes of this subpart, such delivery shall be deemed subscription-on-demand rather than a pay television transmission.

(r) Undefined business model shall mean a business model that does not fall within the definition of a defined business model.

(s) Unencrypted broadcast television means the retransmission by a covered entity of any service, program, or schedule or group of programs originally broadcast in the clear without use of a commercially-adopted access control method by a terrestrial television broadcast station regardless of whether such covered entity employs an access control method as a part of its retransmission.

(1) Each such individual program is generally uninterrupted by commercial advertising messages;
