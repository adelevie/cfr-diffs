Violation of a consent order shall subject the consenting party to any and all sanctions which could have been imposed in the proceeding resulting in the consent order if all of the issues in that proceeding had been decided against the consenting party and to any further sanctions for violation noted as agreed upon in the consent order. The Commission shall have the burden of showing that the consent order has been violated in some (but not in every) respect. Violation of the consent order and the sanctions to be imposed shall be the only issues considered in a proceeding concerning such an alleged violation.
