After a witness is called and has given direct testimony in a hearing, and before he is excused, any party may move for the production of any statement of such witness, or part thereof, pertaining to his direct testimony, in possession of the party calling the witness, if such statement has been reduced to writing and signed or otherwise approved or adopted by the witness. Such motion shall be directed to the presiding officer. If the party declines to furnish the statement, the testimony of the witness pertaining to the requested statement shall be stricken.
