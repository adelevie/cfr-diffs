(a) Each communication common carrier engaged directly in the transmission or reception of telegraph communications between the continental United States and any foreign country (other than one to which the domestic word-count applies) shall file a report with the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of any arrangement concerning the division of the total telegraph charges on such communications other than transiting. A carrier first becoming subject to the provisions of this section must, within thirty (30) days thereafter, file with the Commission a report covering any such existing arrangements.

(b) In the event that any change is made which affects data previously filed, a revised page incorporating such change or changes must be filed with the Commission not later than thirty (30) days from the date the change is made, provided, however, that any change in the amount of foreign participation in charges for outbound communications or in the respondent's participation in charges for inbound communications must be filed not later than thirty (30) days from the date the change is agreed upon.

(c) A single copy of each such report must be filed in a format that contains a clear, concise and definite statement of the arrangements.
