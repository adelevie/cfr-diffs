(a) Verification signifies that the manufacturer or importer has determined that the equipment has been shown to be capable of compliance with the applicable technical standards if no unauthorized change is made in the equipment and if the equipment is properly maintained and operated. Compliance with these standards shall not be construed to be a finding by the manufacturer or importer with respect to matters not encompassed by the Commission's rules.

(b) Verification of the equipment by the manufacturer or importer is effective until a termination date is otherwise established by the Commission.

(c) No person shall, in any advertising matter, brochure, etc., use or make reference to a verification in a deceptive or misleading manner or convey the impression that such verification reflects more than a determination by the manufacturer or importer that the device or product has been shown to be capable of compliance with the applicable technical standards of the Commission's rules.
