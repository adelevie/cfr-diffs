(a) The intentional radiator shall be restricted to use as an auditory assistance device.

(b) Emissions from the intentional radiator shall be confined within a band 200 kHz wide centered on the operating frequency. The 200 kHz band shall lie wholly within the above specified frequency ranges.

(c) The field strength of any emissions within the permitted 200 kHz band shall not exceed 80 millivolts/meter at 3 meters. The field strength of any emissions radiated on any frequency outside of the specified 200 kHz band shall not exceed 1500 microvolts/meter at 3 meters. The emission limits in this paragraph are based on measurement instrumentation employing an average detector. The provisions in ยง 15.35 for limiting peak emissions apply.
