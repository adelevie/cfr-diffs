(a) For the purposes of this section, the terms unencrypted digital terrestrial broadcast content, EIT, PMT, broadcast flag, covered demodulator product, and marked content shall have the same meaning as set forth in ยง 73.9000 of this chapter.

(b) Encrypted retransmission. Where a multichannel video programming distributor retransmits unencrypted digital terrestrial broadcast content in encrypted form, such distributor shall, upon demodulation of the 8-VSB, 16-VSB, 64-QAM or 256-QAM signal, inspect either the EIT or PMT for the broadcast flag, and if the broadcast flag is present:

(1) Securely and robustly convey that information to the consumer product used to decrypt the distributor's signal information, and

(2) Require that such consumer product, following such decryption, protect the content of such signal as if it were a covered demodulator product receiving marked content.

(c) Unencrypted retransmission. Where a multichannel video programming distributor retransmits unencrypted digital terrestrial broadcast content in unencrypted form, such distributor shall, upon demodulation:

(1) Preserve the broadcast flag, if present, in both the EIT and PMT; and

(2) Use 8-VSB, 16-VSB, 64-QAM, or 256-QAM signal modulation for the retransmission.

(d) Unmarked content. Where a multichannel video programming distributor retransmits unencrypted digital terrestrial broadcast content that is not marked with the broadcast flag, the multichannel video programming distributor shall not encode such content to restrict its redistribution.
