(d) In the microwave, aural broadcast auxiliary, and television broadcast auxiliary services:

(1) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the following, in addition to those filings listed in paragraph (a) of this section, are major actions that apply to stations licensed to provide fixed point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, or multipoint-to-point, communications on a site-specific basis, or fixed or mobile communications on an area-specific basis under part 101 of this chapter:

(i) Any change in transmit antenna location by more than 5 seconds in latitude or longitude for fixed point-to-point facilities (e.g., a 5 second change in latitude, longitude, or both would be minor); any change in coordinates of the center of operation or increase in radius of a circular area of operation, or any expansion in any direction in the latitude or longitude limits of a rectangular area of operation, or any change in any other kind of area operation;

(ii) Any increase in frequency tolerance;

(iii) Any increase in bandwidth;

(iv) Any change in emission type;

(v) Any increase in EIRP greater than 3 dB;

(vii) Any increase in transmit antenna beamwidth, except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section;

(viii) Any change in transmit antenna polarization;

(ix) Any change in transmit antenna azimuth greater than 1 degree, except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section ; or,

(x) Any change which together with all minor modifications or amendments since the last major modification or amendment produces a cumulative effect exceeding any of the above major criteria.

(2) Changes to transmit antenna location of Multiple Address System (MAS) Remote Units and Digital Electronic Message Service (DEMS) User Units are not major.
