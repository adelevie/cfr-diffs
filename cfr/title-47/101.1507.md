Licensees may use the 70 GHz, 80 GHz and 90 GHz bands for any point-to-point, non-broadcast service. The segments may be unpaired or paired, but paring will be permitted only in a standardized manner (e.g., 71-72.25 GHz may be paired only with 81-82.25 GHz, and so on). The segments may be aggregated without limit.
