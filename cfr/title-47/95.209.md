(a) Your R/C station may transmit only with:

(1) An FCC certificated R/C transmitter (certificated means the FCC has determined that certain radio equipment is capable of meeting recommended standards for operation); or

(2) A non-certificated R/C transmitter on Channels 26.995-27.255 MHz if it complies with the technical standards (see part 95, subpart E).

(3) Use of a transmitter outside of the band 26.955-27.255 MHz which is not certificated voids your authority to operate the station. Use of a transmitter in the band 26.995-27.255 MHz which does not comply with the technical standards voids your authority to operate the station.

(b) You may examine a list of certificated transmitters at any FCC field office.

(c) Your R/C station may transmit with a transmitter assembled from a kit.

(d) You must not make, or have made, any internal modification to a certificated transmitter. (See R/C Rule 22.) Any internal modification to a certificated transmitter cancels the certification, and use of such a transmitter voids your authority to operate the station.
