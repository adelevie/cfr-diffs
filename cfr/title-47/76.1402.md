(a) A local franchise authority may file rate complaints with the Commission within 180 days of the effective date of a rate increase on the cable operator's cable programming services tier if within 90 days of that increase the local franchise authority receives more than one subscriber complaint concerning the increase.

(b) Before filing a rate complaint with the Commission, the local franchise authority must first give the cable operator written notice, including a draft FCC Form 329, of the local franchise authority's intent to file the complaint. The local franchise authority must give an operator a minimum of 30 days to file with the local franchise authority the relevant FCC forms that must be filed to justify a rate increase or, where appropriate, certification that the operator is not subject to rate regulation. The operator must file a complete response with the local franchise authority within the time period specified by the local franchise authority. The local franchise authority shall file with the Commission the complaint and the operator's response to the Complaint. If the operator's response to the complaint asserts that the operator is exempt from rate regulation, the operator's response can be filed with the local franchise authority without filing specific FCC Forms.
