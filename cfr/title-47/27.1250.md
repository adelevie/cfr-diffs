The 2150-2160/62 MHz band has been allocated for use by the Advanced Wireless Service (AWS). The rules in this section provide for a transition period during which AWS licensees may relocate existing Broadband Radio Service (BRS) licensees using these frequencies to their assigned frequencies in the 2496-2690 MHz band or other media.

(a) AWS licensees and BRS licensees shall engage in mandatory negotiations for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the BRS licensees would:

(1) Relocate their operations to other frequency bands or other media; or alternatively

(2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the AWS licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the BRS operations.

(b) If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation period, an AWS licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures. Under involuntary relocation, the incumbent is required to relocate, provided that the AWS licensee meets the conditions of ยง 27.1252.

(c) Relocation of BRS licensees by AWS licensees will be subject to a three-year mandatory negotiation period. BRS licensees may suspend the running of the three-year negotiation period for up to one year if the BRS licensee cannot be relocated to comparable facilities at the time the AWS licensee seeks entry into the band.
