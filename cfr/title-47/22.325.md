Each station in the Public Mobile Services must have at least one control point and a person on duty who is responsible for station operation. This section does not require that the person on duty be at the control point or continuously monitor all transmissions of the station. However, the control point must have facilities that enable the person on duty to turn off the transmitters in the event of a malfunction.
