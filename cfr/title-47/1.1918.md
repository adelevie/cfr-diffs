(a) The term individual means a natural person, and the term consumer reporting agency has the meaning provided in the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3) or the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 168a(f).

(b) The Commission may disclose to a consumer reporting agency, or provide information to the Treasury who may disclose to a consumer reporting agency from a system of records, information that an individual is responsible for a claim. System information includes, for example, name, taxpayer identification number, business and home address, business and home telephone numbers, the amount of the debt, the amount of unpaid principle, the late period, and the payment history. Before the Commission reports the information, it will:

(1) Provide notice required by section 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) that information in the system may be disclosed to a consumer reporting agency;

(2) Review the claim to determine that it is valid and overdue;

(3) Make reasonable efforts using information provided by the debtor in Commission files to notify the debtor, unless otherwise specified under the terms of a contract or agreement—

(i) That payment of the claim is overdue;

(ii) That, within not less than 60 days from the date of the notice, the Commission intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency that the individual is responsible for that claim;

(iii) That information in the system of records may be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency; and

(iv) That unless otherwise specified and agreed to in an agreement, contract, or by the terms of a note and/or security agreement, or that the debt arises from the nonpayment of a Commission fee, penalty, or other statutory or regulatory obligations, the individual will be provided with an explanation of the claim, and, as appropriate, procedures to dispute information in the records of the agency about the claim, and to administrative appeal or review of the claim; and

(4) Review Commission records to determine that the individual has not—

(i) Repaid or agreed to repay the claim under a written repayment plan agreed to and signed by both the individual and the Commission's representative; or, if eligible; and

(ii) Filed for review of the claim under paragraph (g) of this section;

(c) The Commission shall: (1) Disclose to each consumer reporting agency to which the original disclosure was made a substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim;

(2) Verify or correct promptly information about the claim, on request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of any or all information so disclosed; and

(3) Obtain assurances from each consumer reporting agency that they are complying with all laws of the United States relating to providing consumer credit information.

(d) The Commission shall ensure that information disclosed to the consumer reporting agency is limited to—
                                    

(1) Information necessary to establish the identity of the individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number;

(2) The amount, status, and history of the claim; and

(3) The agency or program under which the claim arose.

(e) All accounts in excess of $100 that have been delinquent more than 31 days will normally be referred to a consumer reporting agency.

(f) Under the same provisions as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission may disclose to a credit reporting agency, information relating to a debtor other than a natural person. Such commercial debt accounts are not covered by the Privacy Act. Moreover, commercial debt accounts are subject to the Commission's rules concerning debt obligation, including part 1 rules related to auction debt, and the agreements of the parties.
