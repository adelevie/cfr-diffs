(a) Petition—(1) Content. Petitions seeking investigation, suspension, or rejection of a new or revised tariff filing or any provision thereof shall specify the filing's Federal Communications Commission tariff number and carrier transmittal number, the items against which protest is made, and the specific reasons why the protested tariff filing warrants investigation, suspension, or rejection under the Communications Act. No petition shall include a prayer that it also be considered a formal complaint. Any formal complaint shall be filed as a separate pleading as provided in § 1.721.

(i) Petitions seeking investigation, suspension, or rejection of a new or revised tariff filing or any provision of such a publication, must specify the pertinent Federal Communications Commission tariff number and carrier transmittal number; the matters protested; and the specific reasons why the tariff warrants investigation, suspension, or rejection. When a single petition asks for more than one form of relief, it must separately and distinctly plead and support each form of relief. However, no petition may ask that it also be considered a formal complaint. Formal complaints must be separately lodged, as provided in § 1.721.

(ii) For purposes of this section, tariff filings by nondominant carriers will be considered prima facie lawful, and will not be suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows:

(A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found unlawful after investigation;

(B) That the harm alleged to competition would be more substantial than the injury to the public arising from the unavailability of the service pursuant to the rates and conditions proposed in the tariff filing;

(C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not suspended; and

(D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

(iii) For the purpose of this section, any tariff filing by a local exchange carrier filed pursuant to the requirements of § 61.39 will be considered prima facie lawful and will not be suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows that the cost and demand studies or average schedule information was not provided upon reasonable request. If such a showing is not made, then the filing will be considered prima facie lawful and will not be suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows each of the following:

(A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found unlawful after investigation;

(B) That any unreasonable rate would not be corrected in a subsequent filing;

(C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not suspended; and

(D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

(iv) For the purposes of this section, tariff filings made pursuant to § 61.49(b) by carriers subject to price cap regulation will be considered prima facie lawful, and will not be suspended by the Commission unless the petition shows that the support information required in § 61.49(b) was not provided, or unless the petition requesting suspension shows each of the following:

(A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found unlawful after investigation;

(B) That the suspension would not substantially harm other interested parties;

(C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not suspended; and

(D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

(v) For the purposes of this section, any tariff filing by a price cap LEC filed pursuant to the requirements of § 61.42(d)(4)(ii) of this chapter will be considered prima facie lawful, and will not be suspended by the Commission unless the petition requesting suspension shows each of the following:

(A) That there is a high probability the tariff would be found unlawful after investigation;

(B) That any unreasonable rate would not be corrected in a subsequent filing;

(C) That irreparable injury will result if the tariff filing is not suspended; and

(D) That the suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the public interest.
