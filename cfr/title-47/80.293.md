The requirement for calibration by check bearings is met if:

(a) The required verification by check bearings are made not more than 90 days prior to the date of the annual detailed inspection of the radiotelegraph station;

At least one comparison bearing must be taken in each quadrant, within plus or minus 20 degrees from the following bearings relative to the ship's heading: 45 degrees; 135 degrees; 225 degrees; 315 degrees;

(c) The verification shows the visual bearing relative to the ship's heading and the difference between the visual and radio direction finder bearing, and the date each check bearing is taken.
