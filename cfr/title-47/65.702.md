(a) For exchange carriers, earnings shall be measured separately for each access service category for purposes of determining compliance with the maximum allowable rate of return. The access service categories shall be: an aggregated category consisting of Special Access, § 69.113, and Contribution Charges for Special Access Expanded Interconnection, § 69.122; Connection Charges for Expanded Interconnection, § 69.121; Common Line, §§ 69.104-69.105; and an aggregated category consisting of Line Termination, § 69.106, Intercept, § 69.108, Local Switching, § 69.107, Transport, §§ 69.110-69.112, 69.124, 69.125, and Information, § 69.109. The Billing and Collection access element shall not be included in any access service category for purposes of this part. The Commission will also separately review exchange carrier overall interstate earnings subject to this part for determining compliance with the maximum allowable rate of return determined by § 65.700(b).

(b) For exchange carriers, earnings shall be measured for purposes of determining compliance with the maximum allowable rates of return separately for each study area; provided, however, that if the carrier has filed or concurred in access tariffs aggregating costs and rates for two or more study areas, the earnings will be determined for the aggregated study areas rather than for each study area separately. If an exchange carrier has not utilized the same level of study area aggregation during the entire two-year earnings review period, then the carrier's earnings will be measured for the entire two-year period on the basis of the tariffs in effect at the end of the second year of the two-year review period; provided, however, that if tariffs representing a higher level of study area aggregation were not in effect for at least eight months in the second year, then the carrier's earnings will be measured on the basis of the study area level of aggregation in effect for the majority of the two-year period; provided further, that any carrier that was not a member of the National Exchange Carrier Association or other voluntary pools for both years of the two-year review period will have its earnings reviewed individually for the full two-year period.
