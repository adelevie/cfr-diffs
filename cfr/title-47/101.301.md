Any common carrier authorized under the rules of this part may render to any agency of the United States Government free service in connection with the preparation for the national defense. Every such carrier rendering any such free service must make and file, in duplicate, with the Commission, on or before the 31st of July and on or before the 31st day of January in each year, reports covering the periods of 6 months ending on the 30th of June and the 31st of December, respectively, next prior to said dates. These reports must show the names of the agencies to which free service was rendered pursuant to this rule, the general character of the communications handled for each agency, and the charges in dollars which would have accrued to the carrier for such service rendered to each agency if charges for such communications had been collected at the published tariff rates.
