(34) In the bands 6,875-7,125 MHz and 12,700-13,150 MHz, links shall not intersect with the service areas of television pickup stations.
                                    

(l) 6875 to 7125 MHz. 25 MHz authorized bandwidth.

(1) 5 MHz bandwidth channels:
                                    

(2) 8.33 MHz bandwidth channels:

(3) 12.5 MHz bandwidth channels:

(4) 25 MHz bandwidth channels:

(p)12,200 to 13,150 MHz. (1) 12,000-12,700 MHz. The Commission has allocated the 12.2-12.7 GHz band for use by the Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS), the Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS), and the Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit Fixed Satellite Service (NGSO FSS). MVDDS shall be licensed on a non-harmful interference co-primary basis to existing DBS operations and on a co-primary basis with NGSO FSS stations in this band. MVDDS use can be on a common carrier and/or non-common carrier basis and can use channels of any desired bandwidth up to the maximum of 500 MHz provided the EIRP does not exceed 14 dBm per 24 megahertz. Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations authorized after September 9, 1983, are licensed on a non-harmful interference basis to DBS and are required to make any and all adjustments necessary to prevent harmful interference to operating domestic DBS receivers. Incumbent public safety licensees shall be afforded protection from MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees, however all other private operational fixed licensees shall be secondary to DBS, MVDDS and NGSO FSS licensees. As of May 23, 2002, the Commission no longer accepts applications for new licenses for point-to-point private operational fixed stations in this band, however, incumbent licensees and previously filed applicants may file applications for minor modifications and amendments (as defined in ยง 1.929 of this chapter) thereto, renewals, transfer of control, or assignment of license. Notwithstanding any other provisions, no private operational fixed point-to-point microwave stations are permitted to cause harmful interference to broadcasting-satellite stations of other countries operating in accordance with the Region 2 plan for the Broadcasting-Satellite Service established at the 1983 WARC.

(2) 12,700 to 13,150 MHz. 50 MHz authorized bandwidth.

(i) 5 MHz channels:

(ii) 8.33 MHz bandwidth channels:

(iii) 12.5 MHz bandwidth channels:

(iv) 25 MHz bandwidth channels:

(v) 50 MHz bandwidth channels:
