(b) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any documents or information not included in the prescribed application form, a failure to comply with such request will constitute a defect in the application.

(c) Applications that are not in accordance with the Commission's rules, regulations, or other requirements will be considered defective unless accompanied either by:

(1) a petition to amend any rule, regulation, or requirement with which the application is in conflict; or
