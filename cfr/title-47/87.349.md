(a) The frequency assigned to an aeronautical utility station at an airport served by a control tower, RCO or FAA flight service station is the frequency used by the control tower for ground traffic control or by the flight service station for communications with vehicles. In addition to the ground control frequency, an aeronautical utility station at an airport served by a control tower or RCO may be assigned the tower or RCO frequency if the assignment is specifically approved by the FAA as provided for in ยง 87.347(c). The frequencies assigned are normally from the band 121.600-121.925 MHz.

(b) The frequency assigned to the unicom is available to aeronautical utility stations on a noninterference basis at airports which have a part-time control tower, part-time RCO or part-time FAA flight service station and a unicom.

(c) At airports which have a unicom but no control tower, RCO or FAA flight service station, the frequency assigned to the unicom is available to aeronautical utility stations on a noninterference basis. The frequencies available for assignment to unicoms are described in subpart G of this part.

(d) At airports which have no control tower, RCO, flight service station or unicom, the frequency 122.900 MHz is available for assignment to aeronautical utility stations.

(e) The frequency 978.0 MHz is authorized for Universal Access Transceiver data transmission.
