Because of the potential for interference to the reception of TV Channels 4 and 5 by broadcast television sets and video recorders, assignments of the 72-76 MHz channels are subject to the following conditions:

(a) Assignments of 72-76 MHz channels for use within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5 are subject to the condition that the licensee must eliminate any interference caused to television reception on TV Channels 4 and 5. If the FCC notifies the licensee of an interference problem and the licensee does not resolve the problem within 90 days of such notification, operation of the interfering 72-76 MHz fixed station must be immediately discontinued.

(b) 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned for use within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5 under a developmental authorization, pursuant to ยง 22.413. However, for use within 50 meters (164 feet) of a TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5, 72-76 MHZ channels may be assigned under a regular authorization, rather than a developmental authorization.
