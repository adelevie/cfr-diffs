(a) There must be readily available for use under normal load conditions, a power supply sufficient to simultaneously energize the bridge-to-bridge transmitter at its required antenna power, and the bridge-to-bridge receiver. Under this load condition the voltage of the power supply at the power input terminals of the bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone installation must not deviate from its rated voltage by more than 10 percent on vessels completed on or after March 1, 1957, nor by more than 15 percent on vessels completed before that date.

(b) When the power supply for a nonportable bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone installation consists of or includes batteries, they must be installed as high above the bilge as practicable, secured against shifting with motion of the vessel, and accessible with not less than 26 cm (10 in.) head room.

(c) Means must be provided for adequately charging any rechargeable batteries used in the vessel's bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone installation. There must be provided a device which will give a continuous indication of the charging current during charging.
