(a) All transmissions by each CTS and by each RTU shall use an emission type that complies with the following standard for unnecessary radiation.

(b) All spurious and out-of-band emissions shall be attenuated:

(1) Zero dB on any frequency within the authorized frequency segment.

(2) At least 28 dB on any frequency removed from the midpoint of the assigned frequency segment by more than 250 kHz up to and including 750 kHz;
                                    

(3) At least 35 dB on any frequency removed from the midpoint of the assigned frequency segment by more than 750 kHz up to and including 1250 kHz;

(4) At least 43 plus 10 log (base 10) (mean power in watts) dB on any frequency removed from the midpoint of the assigned frequency segment by more than 1250 kHz.

(c) When testing for certification, all measurements of unnecessary radiation are performed using a carrier frequency as close to the edge of the authorized frequency segment as the transmitter is designed to be capable of operating.

(d) The resolution bandwidth of the instrumentation used to measure the emission power shall be 100 Hz for measuring emissions up to and including 250 kHz from the edge of the authorized frequency segment, and 10 kHz for measuring emissions more than 250 kHz from the edge of the authorized frequency segment. If a video filter is used, its bandwidth shall not be less than the resolution bandwidth. The power level of the highest emission within the frequency segment, to which the attenuation is referenced, shall be remeasured for each change in resolution bandwidth.
